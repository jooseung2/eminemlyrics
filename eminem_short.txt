Peace to Thirstin Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed, wit badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin wit your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
Wit smeard letters, runnin together in blurred spurts
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's
My first words were "Bleep bleep" and "Curse curse"
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs
Yankin out my stitches, hollering "Nurse nurse!"
"You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse!"
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
And it's like that, and it's like that

Evidence]
Got no apathy
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you here's the diff
Gun to your head, you're dead, pointblank I shapeshift
That's right, to dear/deer, anelope, or owl
In life, use your potential, or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, yo too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout
You say I use my name too much as a clutch
Try holdin on to beat instead of pushin on your crutch
Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you comin 
Deaf/Def like Leppards, pop the piece, I be the sheppard
Causin the herd, the name is Ev absurd
Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that
Methaphor imagery, you claimin metaphors and spittin similies
Not havin It, the name is Evidence
Like Pos. K gibbin the life thinkin of stabbin it
Skills prevail you possess, take no offense
But don't profess lies within your mind, tempt and stress

It's like uh-oh-oh
It's Dilated Peoples on the Wake Up Show-uh-oh
We kick a lick or some for the radio-uh-oh
Yo CaTashTrophic like Rico *fades out*</p>

I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em, quickest damn gun slinger I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood, that ol' saloon there was their lil' home
Away from home, they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live
In that tavern and on a quiet night, you can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said

Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil, intelligence level is hellier than
Treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto

Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missiles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth

'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal
Above the law 'cuz I don't agree wit police either
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle

I breathe ether in three amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
He's insane, no I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off 'cuz I can't find a decent vain

The disaster wit dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cuz I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral

Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows crackin' jaws
Wit my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' MC's, at the same time amazin' MC's
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt

Hello? Billy, aiyyo what's up
We're comin' to get you
Stop, they know it's us

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down
Well I'm out now, and this time
I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gone leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
We'll be waitin', See you in hell
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel, bye bye
Bad meets evil, what? Till next time

{And so that's the story when bad meets evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Wait, did y'all hear that?}</p>
]

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when
I ended up this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel dissin' again
So I decided just to pick this pen

Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I can't just sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others' eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room

Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like

Ha! Marshall you're so funny man
You should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help

Now I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in
Every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that

'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin
It's probably 110% different

I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you

So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon

And to the rest of the world
God gave you shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you you ain't beautiful</p>

B-Rabbit Vs. Papa Doc (Freestyle From 8 Mile)



Now everybody from the 313 
Put your mothefucking hands and follow me
Everybody from the 313 
Put your mothefucking hands up
Look Look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not had his hands up
The free world got you gased up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none

This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
I know everything he's got to say against me,
I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,
My boy future is an uncle tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob who shoots
himself in the leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl,
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't ever try to judge me dude 
You don't know what the fuck i've been through

But i know something about you
You went to Crankbook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrased?
This is guy's a gangster, he's real name's Clarence

And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
'Cause there no such things as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Crankbook

Fuck the beat, i go acapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly 
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty, 
Here, tell this people something they dont know about me.</p>

Yo! Turn that click off…

My music is theraputic
But its also provin
That it can put you in the mood to 
jump out your car while it's movin
You been waitin' on this moment
My sermon is like a omen
I'm servin' I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open 
And I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book
Go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it
Rummage,and find something
you can use to jump someone
And roll up bumpin
I'm constantly copin' over you
Squattin', shit has gotten to the point
Where I ain't even writin' no more, I'm just jottin'
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickenin'
I've been kickin' ass off bullshit
Throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
Ive made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Cannabis
Then it's Dre's fee, you Kay Slay the fees waved
I stay beefin' with JD, till the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin' him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape
And the tape leaped, "Say What You Say" mothafucka
Drama King, Kay Slay, mothafucka, We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka
Xzibit blaze little gay midget cocksucka</p>

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got 'em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways fuck it
What's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too
I'm out to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam

I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this, man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote
I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad
I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didn't have to
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man

He's only 6 years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For 4 hours and you just said "No"
That's pretty shitty man
You're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you, you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
It's like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous
'Cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like
I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
You've gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word
I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you
I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now
I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka
Ya dare me to drive?

You know this song by Phil Collins
'From the air in the night'
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him

That's kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late
I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we could have been together
Think about it, you ruined it now

I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you can't breathe without me

See Slim, "Shut up bitch!
I'm trying to talk"
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up
See I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
And then she'll die too

Well gotta go
I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner
But I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look I'm really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on your starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show
I must have missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin' dawg
C'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counselin''
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls
When you get down some
And what's this shit about us
Meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us
To meet each other

I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you'd relax a little

I'm glad I inspire you
But Stan, why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didn't say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was, it was you! Damn!</p>

And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman
This movie is P.G. mister officer, I demand to see my attorney

I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets

]

Yeah, I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip, what you cryin' about? You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney
Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep up sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever
Bein' together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be but it's just somethin'
That we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold you through the night

I know mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny, I remember back one year
When daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree

And said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block

And your mom, was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart

And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara

And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' daddy on the TV

And momma didn't like it and you and Laney were too young
To understand that papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry, you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin', lookin'
At your baby pictures, it just trips me out to see how much
You both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold you through the night

I know mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird, I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing
And that ring don't shine, I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad, ha ha</p>
]

Em, it's Paul, listen
Joel just called me and he told me
You're in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range

I told you not to fucking bring your gun around like an idiot
Outside of your home, you're gonna get yourself in trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home, you can't carry it on you
Leave your fucking gun at home</p>

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world

So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot
Think I've got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot

Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop

Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool

The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, took a see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice

How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife she ever saw in her life

I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a 'Fuck you' letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady

Yo, I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit

But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we're on the subject
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it

I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms
Do drink beer, I just wanna make a few things clear

My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitchin'
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for bein' AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady

I told you I was Shady, yo, y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady and that's my name</p>

Paint be flyin' off my car
Be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids

Hit the wheels on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
32-inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat?
Custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, "Ah, there go them superstars!"

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture
It's the return of the, "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!
Feminist women love Eminem
Chigga chigga chigga, "Slim shady, I'm sick of him

Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss"
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the discovery channel don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals", well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first

You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up

So, will the real shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady

So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up

Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with
Chris's paws like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue muthfucker

Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic

Pretty mouth and a good jaw

Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch, you listening tryna' turn me down
Slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car

Shut the fuck up while my shits playin'
I'ma shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder there's lightening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate ocassions?

And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the pyschopath
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash

So hit the dance floor, cutie
While I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodi

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check one two, we recordin'?

I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin

You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono

Ohh no, so if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet

My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin' lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says

Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill

Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist

I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco

My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer

My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
Witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn

I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel

Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
A main vein' with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sighed, either I'm high, or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I

So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me

I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me</p>

Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in piss
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just, put it all into all I spit
Instead of always tryin to swallow it
Instead of starin at this wall and shit
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit

All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of mom's alcholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic
I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up
Blow this buildin up, I've been sealed enough
My cup, runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts?
Well I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peal the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see

Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out there mind as me
You need piece of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin at that time
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one-two, then half past three

This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in this slum, can't think of nothin
Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Signed out of spit to the grave
Real enough to rill you up
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin boilin point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chainlink fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear their jaws was comin
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin someone
By the way they're runnin, you would swear the law was comin
It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin
Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my nitch, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I had half a chance I'd grab it - Rabbit, run</p>

I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
Till one night he snuck in and said
"We're goin' out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"

"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest", the next day my mother said
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"

"The bastard won't even eat nothin', he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead"
"Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck"

"I bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I'll bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object?"
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head"

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

Did you get him? Naw the fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot

Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong

Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything 'cept his tank top and his trainin' bra

Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady Dog
Man, that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he, dog?
Shady Dog, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

Don't you know what feltch means? Yeah, well then tell me
Would you rather get feltched or do the feltchin'?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belchin'
Burp, belch and go back for a second helpin'

Can you dig what I'm sayin', man, could you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelpin'
Shady, what the fuck you sayin'? I don't know help me

What the fuck's happenin'? I think I'm fuckin' meltin'
"Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well being"
No Dad, I said, no, I don't need no help peein'
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see

I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like 'Nightmare on Elm Street'
But it was X and they called it 'Pubic Hair on Chelsea'
Well, this one's called 'Ass Rape' and we're shootin' the jail scene

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane</p>

Eminem Part 1
Met a retarted kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44-D
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas
Cross the bombest
We blowing up your house
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes
On Vietnam war vets
I am more or less sick in the head
Maybe more 
Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,
and the day before Sabateur
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure</p>
]

Ayo, before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And baring with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

Yeah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
What I was going through growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne

It's like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too

God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank god that I didn't do it
I would of had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it

Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying
Your health is declining with your self esteem, you're crying out for help

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin' self loathing and hollow
Bottoms up of pill bottle maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow

But I must be talkin' to the wall though
I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater I've put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac, that's not his motto

He's not a desperado, he's desperate, it's startin' to bottle
Inside 'em, one foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mc Donalds
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it

Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isn't them it's you you fuckin', baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do fuckin' Shady
I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin' slam before I drown
Hit my bottom so hard I bounce twice suffice this time around
It's different them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come up to make it up to you no more fucking around
I've got something to prove to fans I feel like I let em down

So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you
For those of you who don't know
The new mes back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin' up, pullin' up, blowin' up, all over no mo
My life is no longer a movie but the shows aint over homos

I'm back with a vengeance homie Weezy keep ya head up
TI keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up
Don't let up, just keep slayin' 'em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM 'cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

So here it is, dang, this feels like I just woke up or somethin'
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, ma
Ay, yo, is anybody I thought about goin' at
'Twas never nothin' personal
'Cause of some shit I was goin' thru', it's everybody else
I'm back, ay, yo</p>
]

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves

I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people and 5 I hit, ah shit
I started a mosh pit, squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids

These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again

So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down

We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out

Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid 'cos the X is gone

Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and fulla cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue

You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid, you so high
That you might wake up with a guy

On some new shit, I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills and green big pills
(That's ill)
Mescaline

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen, 80 of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno

Pop pills, pills I pop, pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray

Look for coke to smoke, no oki dok
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy)

I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs 'cos our arms show tracks

Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue

Speed, shrooms, down the valium
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

I'm at a rave, looking like a slave
High off chronic, gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?

Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill, drugs kill
(Yeah right)
Bitch I'm for real, shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen, 80 of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno, fuck it</p>

Come get me
If you mothafuckas want Shady
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na

Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Miles like a .12 gauge shotti

Chorus 2x]

Eminem]
You ain't a killa, you a pussy
That exstacy got you all emotional and moushy
Bitches wearin rages in photos, Ja's words bein quoted
In the SOURCE, stealin 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouth, pray to god, hope that no one's listenin
See 50 comin for me, I'ma guard my, my position
No one will pay attention
To me, please Gotti, here I go
Gimme this pill, exstacy got me feelin so
Invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin mad man who screams
Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy
Actin like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fuck from this shit
I'm stuck, addicted from these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin mothafucka's name's before someone fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you hell, fucker

Hell, I done been in jail, I ain't scared
Momma checkin in my bedroom, I ain't there

Mmhh
You high baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Ha ha ha, talk to me
You want me to tell you somethin'?
Uh huh
I know what you wanna hear

'Cuz I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down

In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face

I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cuz I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes

We'll be friends I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
You'll never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then

You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie

But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

First thing you said
I'm not phazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me

Ooh yeah girl run that game
Hailie Jade I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot in pieces' aww that's great

First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool

There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good lordy-wody
You must be gone off that water bottle

You want what you can't have
Ooo girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands

Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

'Cuz I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

These ideas are nightmares for white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearin'
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearin'
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone cold and he don't care
He's a problem child what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants two rags and a stockin' cap
His step father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose this house is a broken home
There's no control he just lets his emotions go
(C'mon)

Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is danger intertwine it with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Only you're unholy only have one homey
Only this gun lonely 'cuz don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
Or they can be great or even worse they can teach hate
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you attorney's all gonna turn it to
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
You need to spew don't hesitate to produce air guns
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Swiftly just to get me off these streets quickly
But all their kids been listen to me religiously
So I'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, Pete
It's all political if my music is literal and I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you

Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?
Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can

Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away</p>

There I go
Thinkin' of you again

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, woh

I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'm a start right here, I'll just be briefer
'Bout to rattle off some other reasons

I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but whatever I gonna do?
I go and get another one, now I got two
Ooh!

Now I'm sittin here, with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did that stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim
Shit!

If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you
Ooh!

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you probably just shred up, yeah

I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made stop
And think of how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink
To a stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see
How much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle

You're a fuckin' cokehead slut, I hope you fuckin' die
You get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you die
Die

But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack
Aack

But what else can I do, I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do
Is puke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you, I puke

Goddamn it
Fuckin' bitch</p>

Eminem
Slim Shady EP
If I Had... (Radio Edit)
Life.. by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J-L-B saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Know what I'm sayin?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?
Just fed up
That's my word</p>
]

Okay, guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time

Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys

That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go

Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)

It's Friday and it's my day
Used to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
Man you must be up out yo mind
Dre, ah, ah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah)

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' "Ah ah ah ah"
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said. "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady touch my body"

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba

Tellytubby fellas, what, fellas, what
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous what
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go ah ah ah ah, it's so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby, baby
(Ah ah)

Touch my body, touch my body
Oh boy just touch my body, I mean girl just touch my body</p>

Intro:
*Tuning Tv*
*Eminem Snortin Crack

Tv Presenter:
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
*Door opens*
who's your daddy?

Hailie:
Daddy, what're you doing?

Beat starts

Eminem:
Haha

Eminem &amp; Hailie:
Ok then! everybody, listen up!

Eminem:
I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?

Hailie:
Somebody, please help him!
*giggle*
i think my dad gone crazy!

Verse #1:
There's no mountain i can't climb
There's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, destroy you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound*
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off

Dr Dre:
Suck it marshall

Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and that's all
*Hailie Makes Explosion Sound*
Blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
*Knocking*
Haley, tell 'em baby

Haley:
My dad's lost it

Chorus:
Eminem:
There's really nothin' else to say ha, i can't explain it

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Eminem:
A little help from hailie jade would, should tell them maybe

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Eminem:
Theres nothing you could do to save it, could ever change me

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Eminem:
There's noone on earth that can save me, not even halie

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Verse 2:
It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom*
Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine n goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er..
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks for second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flos, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my ammo
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?

Hailey:
Dad

Chorus

Verse #3:
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
So what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd gank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like r kelly as soon as "bump n' grind" comes on
More pain inside o' my brain, in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on ronny's grave,
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
And nash briddy musta just stop it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heater's desk, and two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither

Chorus

Outro:
Eminem:
Crazy

Hailie:
*laughs*
You're funny daddy!</p>

Whatever, Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully
(Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
(Speak to me)

I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
(Is on empty)

No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air
(Liftin' you 10 feet)
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
(Of all you)
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song
'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
(Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
(On Marilyn)

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now, it's a tragedy
Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin' this happenin'
(This happenin')

Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
(Rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is"

And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
(Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk

With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'
The same fuckin' questions
(Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who what when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
(Drivin' me crazy)
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am</p>

Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well I'm back
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno

Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

You are just jealous of me 'cuz you
You just can't do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me 'cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things 'cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment

Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fuckin' jealous

Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo? Kitty, ka ka, poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
Okay, now I need your undivided attention, sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension

From the moment that I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me, is it just because?

You are just jealous of me 'cuz you
You just can't do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me 'cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things 'cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no, I didn't

That's just what you wanted to hear from me, is that I fucked up ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
Doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're droolin', you have tooth decay

Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?

Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on truth syrum

Marshall I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things it's my own insecurity!

You are just jealous of me 'cuz you
You just can't do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me 'cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things 'cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?

Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on, now look in this mirror
How about now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em

You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth, this is between me and you
I know you're not happy, I know you'd much rather see me lying
In the corner of a room somewhere crying

Curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There's no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless

Why do we have to keep on going through this
This is torturous, my point is this
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, your just is

You are just jealous of me 'cuz you
You just can't do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me 'cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things 'cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Intro]
uh huh. yo. alright, yo

Verse 1] 
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleepin'
I keep dreamin' of death and I'm hearin' people screamin.
The devil's spirits trapped inside me and i want it out,
I'm on a couch, bleeding to death in a haunted house with both of my wrists slit
I'm lifted up in the air and suspended in animation like somebody's holding me there.
I feel somebodies cold hands wrapping around my neck, 
while i choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death. 
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches;
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes. 
Trippin over O.D bodies of dead lushes,
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushies.
Doors open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves, 
the curtains catch fire; the house melts.
My skin blisters, and sticks together like twin sisters,
the wind blows, and shatters windows like ten twisters.
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple,
two cups of Holy water and I'm lookin' at em' half full.
But as soon as I go to touch em' they into red rum,
it got silent then all of these voices said...

Voices]
"Come! Follow me into the pits of Hell!"

Eminem]
I heard them yell

Voices] 
"Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"

End Verse]
I rang the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother,
covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel.
I said, "I need a room so I can try to get some rest." 
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag a cess
and told me that's just for starters;
Satan will be in to see me later, 
to see if I'm interested in being partners.</p>

Just the two of us, just the two of us

Baby, your da-da loves you
(Hey)
And I'ma always be here for you, no matter what happens
(Hey)
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna
Keep you from me, I love you

C'mon, hai-hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys
And let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell, da-da musta runned over a skunk
(Whew!)

Now, I know what you're thinkin' it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it
(No!)

And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle?
(Yeah!)
And Mama said, she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat

It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt, her was eatin'
Dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she? We'll, let her wash off in the water
And me and you can sway by ourselves, can't we?

See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson

And you don't want a brother do ya?
(Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad

But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryin' to climb out
(Wahh!)
I told you, it's okay, hai-hai, wanna ba-ba
Take a night-night, nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga

Her make goo-goo ca-ca, da-da, change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon, as we get to the water

Wake up, sweepy, head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a whittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry ,honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear
(Mama!)

That's why you can't get her to wake but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock?
(Yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready, now, here we go, on the count of free

One , two, free, whee!
(Whoosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the wa-ta
No more fightin' wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother

Blow her kisses, bye-bye, tell Mama you love her
(Mommy!)
Now, we'll go, play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Miscellaneous
My Name is.. (Radio/Video Edit)
* this is the EDITED song version
words that were blanked w/o being replaced are in {}'s

Chorus: repeat 2X

Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is.. Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is.. Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second?

Eminem]
Hi kids! Do you like Primus? (Yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try {'cid} and get messed up worse that my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to {impregnate}
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like a caged elf
who stayed to himself, in one space, chasin his tail (blalblalblabla)
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off
Kissed em and said, "I ain't know silicone was 'sposed to be this soft"
I'm bout to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
faster than a fat man who sat down too fast
C'mere lady! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off!

Chorus

Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Damn!)
Thanks a lot.. next semester, I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and told him to change the grade on the paper (Now!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with a tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they're screamin at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more {dope} than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin {drugs} and name it after her (Here mom!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, {ASSHOLE!}'

Chorus

Eminem]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll {fuck} anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!) YOU AIN'T GOT NO {TITS!} (WAH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and tap myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steamin mad (Arrrggghhh!) 
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Ask him if he bought a porno mag and seen my ad

Chorus</p>

Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady

Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?

Hi kids, do you like violence?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?
(Uh, huh)

Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
(Huh?)

My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead"
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted

Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut
(Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, my name is

(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
(Oww)

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends"

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)

You know you blew up when the women rush your stands

This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph

Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive

(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
(Hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
(C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits

How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head

I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
(Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is

My name is Slim Shady</p>

** feat. Kanye West, Wiz Khalifa &amp; Ron Pope:]


A drop in the ocean a change in the weather*
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert,
But I'm holding you closer than most'cause you are my heaven.

Kanye West:]
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann
I'm wonderin' why she "ret to go" like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I'll trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember when I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around and giggle said; "You so nuts! "
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get the new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.

Eminem:]
So young, so full of life and vibrant,
Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,
So close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shit,
When Ronnie died you was right by my side,
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,
You even had the same type of childhood I did,
Sometimes I just wanna know why,
Is it that you surcame to yours,
And mine I survived it,
You ran the streets I nine to fived it,
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us,
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
Now I feel the vibe I just can't describe it,
Much as your pride tries to hide it,
You're cold your touch, it's like ice,
And your eyes is the look of resentment,
I can sense it and I don't like it

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.

Wiz Khalifa:]
Uh, stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas, it's never a need for brakes
Smoke ez-rider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars, waiter bringing me plates
Shrimp and fillet Mignon, we celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads my nigga's who got love for me
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, I'm a stand out
And view my life through this lens to see how it pan's out
Substitute teacher ass nigga's, need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck them nigga's who hated,
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smokin degraded
Speculating me landing must of got me mistaken,
I'm speaking as the captain of the planes,
You's a runner on the jet way

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
I was praying that you and me might end up together.</p>

Guess who, did you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
   (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?

Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive Gluteus Maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2, you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact I see a grin
Now come in, girl

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charley Horse her
Sorry Portia but what's Ellen DeGeneres have that I don't?
Are you telling me tenderness?

Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend

Brit forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middle man
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention

And little bit did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

And that's why my love you'll never live without
I know you want me, girl, 'cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you

Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad? You should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breast in my mouth bruh
Wowzers! I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about to flip, Jessica
Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down girl

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

So baby
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Oh Amy, rehab never looked so good
I can wait, I'm going back, ha ha, woo!

Obie, yo I'm sick
Damn, you straight dog?

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise, from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should've seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French role styling, body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be a nigga

Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Our clothes fell like bishop and juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my john
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop

Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
The cannon, seen us at my temple when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip

Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of his black folks
Being a vinyl stretched, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated 'cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I ain't really got that shit, fuck

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But whys she shoving me for doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?

Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickened 'n worse
'Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse

So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweating every minute you're in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the menace
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cause you gone get that ho

When you see her, you're gonna bend her fucking neck back yo
'Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceiving, shit this ho's a genius, she geed us

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches
Fuck em all, get money
Ha, shady records
Wow, Obie Trice
Eminem mother fucker
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off, turn this shit the fuck off</p>
]

Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter

I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless
I absolutely have to I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em

That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie`s name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and nas shit

And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'

Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth

While he's all over TV yeah I'm talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated 'cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?

It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Mean while my attention is pullin' in another direction
Some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk

Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us

We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

But I ain't try na have none of my people hurt and murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further

But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws well then I can 'cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cuz

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers</p>

8 Mile Freestyle Pt.II vs "Lotto"



Lotto]
Spoken]
Yo, it's time to get rid of this coward once and for all.
I'm sick of the motha fucka! Check this shit out!
Rap]
I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me!
This shit is a horror flick,
but the black guy doesn't die in this movie!
Fuckin' wit Lotto, dawg, you gotta be kiddin!
That makes me believe you really dont have a interest in livin!
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?
I got a betta chance joining the KKK.
Or some real shit, though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit sucide to
Fuck 'Lotto,' call me your leader
I feel bad I gotta murder that dude from "Leave It To Beaver"
I used to like that show, now you got me to "fight back" mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go!
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last 
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends well, ok?
So I’ll end this shit with a ... fuck you but have a nice day! 

Eminem]
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver 
So was Eddie Haskal, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid!
Quick, someone get his ass another steriod!
"Blahbity bloo blah blah blahbity bloo blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said, "hipidy hooblah!"
Is that a tank top, or a new bra? 
Look, Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job!
Didn't you listen to the last round, meat head? 
Pay attention, you're sayin the same shit that he said!
Matter fact, dog, here's a pencil 
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful, 
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it! You can take the mic home with you!
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you, 
Tank top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far those white jokes get you
Boy's like "How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you?"
My motto: Fuck Lotto! 
I’ll get the 7 digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise
Aw shit, yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well, I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin' I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac

Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa, oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh, oh, you can call me R. Kelly now, unverified]

Trouble, what's occurrin before after endurin' the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushin' you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow

Now stomp your fuckin feet 'til you get to squishin' a hoe
It's pandemonium standin' know when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're givin' me wood
You should, pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood

It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin' over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spittin' the same flames as me?
I'm Kanye when he crashed

In other words, I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn jawbreaker in half

So stop fakin' the funk and start shakin' your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin' than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

I'm right here fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired
Jimmy Io' fire Marshall the 9 tucked against the linin'
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69'in

It's like Rick James is shootin' up your house nigga
Fuck yo' couch nigga
You're screamin' fuck the world with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shovin' my dick in a hole in the mud

My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds

Bad, Evil, we go Alfred, immune in mad cerebral
You on your last burrito
(What that mean Nickel?)
It's a wrap if you eatin'
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touchin' that
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the fuck you at?

I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art, of you nice swear unverified]

It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishin' off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears

I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waitin' to be hooked to IV as unverified]
As well when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine

This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection
What I exhibit seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it?

Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgustin' hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here lettin' the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped

I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin'
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money

Man, all the bitches holla, they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah

Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Attila the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam

Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flyin
We do it to try to do without tryin
(Slaughterhouse)
Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's, Jumpoff Joe Beezy?</p>
]

Scalpel, here, sponge, here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing!
Ah! We're gonna have to shock him! Oh my! Oh my God!
We're gonna have to shock him! Oh my God!

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts, "Nurse we're losin' him, check the pulse!"
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack

My first day in junior high, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache it works"
I screamed, "Oww!  My appendix feels like they could burstâ€

Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse
What's the matter? I don't know, my leg, it hurts
Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy?
Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework
But don't you wanna give me after school detention?
Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat

I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey!"â€
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
  (What's going on in here?)
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left

Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
"This is for every time you took my orange juice,
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back bully!  Now once and for good"
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could

And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs?
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"
  (Sorry!)

She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done"
Oh my God, I'm sorry son, shut up you cunt!  I said, "Fuck it!"
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage</p>

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for like Philly
I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
I apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating and I'm debating

On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls
Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help
I can't do it by myself

Too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying
Around with the idea of ending the shit right here

I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her, shit

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened at you? Can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughin' at you

It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust

Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, nobody, he fights first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills
Yeah 'em, tight verse, you killed it

Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes man
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
  (Don't know what I'm going through)
(But I just keep on going through changes)

My friends just can't understand this new me
That's understandable man but just think how bananas
You'd be, you'd be an animal too, if you were trapped
In this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?

I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive

And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound

Almost in a coma, yeah, homie, come on, don't look now
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah, baby, hold me down

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
  (Don't know what I'm going through)
(But I just keep on going through changes)

Wake up in the hospital
Full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth

Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too

I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day

There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint

I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
  (Don't know what I'm going through)

Drop that anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill

Shit the day that happens the world will stop spinning and Michael J
Fox will come to a stand still
During that earthquake, urine in your face cuz your fake
Ahhh, what the fuck that hurt, wait
Ahhh, what the fuck, I just got struck by lightning

Alright then I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do now forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you, you can repent
But I warn you, if you continue to hell I send you
And just then the wind blew and I said

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ask me why and man I just don't know

No, no, no, no, no, no

Blo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh

How long will I be this way, shady, it's in my dying days
Till I hang up the mic and it's not for me to say
So long till then I drop the fuckin bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long

If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing a long slut, this slut that not the worst of this song
Oh, bitches don't like that
Homie, I'll be nicer to women when aquaman drowns
And human torch starts swimming

Man I'm a cold soul I roll solo so
Don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums
Yeah, I'm bananas pussy cut off the grapes and grow a pear

But I swear, you try to diss me I slaughter you
I'll put that on everything, like everyone does with autotune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm as cold as a cold wind
Blows when it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why and man I just don't know

No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm as cold as a cold wind blows
Blo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh

I don't know, I don't know wat caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I dunno, I dunno but I'll probly be this way till my dying day
I dunno why I'm so, I'm so cold, mean things I don't need to say
I guess this is how you made me</p>

I'm not to joke wit
Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "Who want it?"
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it
My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it
Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager

Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her

The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics 
I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you,

I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber
I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number? ( Ha.. Hot )</p>

8 Mile (Soundtrack)
8 Mile Runnin
by Jay Z / Freeway

Yeah Renegades is back and the beat is sick,
Jay Z, Freeway, 8 Miles,
let's go...

Verse 1
8 miles and running, got my 7 album droppin,
And my 8 album coming,
Feedin a thousand growling stomachs,
But I could rewind the counter ta back, back,
When it was now or nothing,
People said I would amount to nothing,
That I had time for nothing,
Said I wasn't from the valers
or the sellers by your gunman,
I can see the folks now he got what he had coming,
Now that my 8th album's coming,
Everybody smiling wanting something,
claiming that they done something for em,
got Jay Z and pom poms in they whole uniforms,
claiming they be running and telling everybody like Martin Lawrence,
about how hot my rap performace was before I was who I was,
claimin that they threw it up before I threw it up, you what..
Where was you before I blew this up,
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everyone was suein us,
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin up,
back on the block, kickin it in and it was no you with us,


CHORUS
8 miles and running, got my 7 album droppin,
and my 8 album coming,
feedin a thousand growling stomachs, freaks...
6 miles and running got my fist straight poppin,
and my first album coming feedin 20 promises I made

(Repeat)

Verse 2

6 miles and running in the pontiak,
6 thousand 86 trans mic shift,
while the engine run,
anyone turn around
and give me one more chance,
let em smoke and scream em one more grams,
so i'm a bring them, homie, son and my pop,
stick close to my momma, keep toasters for drama,
mix alot with my son, my son growin and he learnin alot,
thats what i'm toastin, thats what i'm burin, so pop,
right on your own, rell 'em nigga, tell 'em nigga,
its like a biblical scripture,
look back turn to salt like the sinners
and most yall heartless and self-centered
like me shaggin, me shack,
set up your brother cause you tell us nigga,
heat back, uh, like, you never love for never
and cops watch every step, 6 miles and running
dodge in every trap, the rap ginger bread man,
cherish every precious breath, stat pick a second gat
uh..

CHORUS

Verse 3

Back when nobody would find me a talent,
Nobody would sign me, nobody believed in me,
Nobody but mommy blindly, but how could she deny me,
Me being the youngest friend to come up out of her,
tell me, she got every love for me,
when niggas would worn me the industry shun me,
that's why I'm taking all the industries money,
revenge is sweet honey, we run this,
young is the illest, free is the future,
beans and bleekers right now,
we can see our 8 miles nigga...

CHORUS</p>
]

Yeah, yeah, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's all so cold, all so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

Fe fi fo fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target with my car and park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider
Hi there, girl, you mighta heard of me before
See whore, you're the kinda girl that I'da
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella, then open it up while that shit's inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, and now let's see her have triplets and I'll
Incinerate them babies soon as they're out her with formaldehyde
Hide in cyanide, girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin' I'd rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, ahh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull, my knife seems dull
Pull another one out, ooh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide and seek like Jason, I'm so hungry

She's naked, see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Close the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatantly but silently 'cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's wakin' me so violently and why's he on top of me?
"He's rapin' me", she tries to scream
"Somebody please get him off me"
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny"
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me
She's scratchin' like some dumb freak

Escapin' me, no die, she see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

Better try to stay wide awake
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitches soul, I'ma try to take
Pray for light today, right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much
Might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how about now while you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement now?
Ya must've just heard the sound
Of my stomach growlin' from down there

Holler, there's no one fowler
Bound to the tub they found ya' face down in the tub
I drowned you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cowered
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' 'Star Wars'

Jaba the hut, be, de, ba, ba, be, de, ba, ba, it's time to die, die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazin' when grazin' skin with these razorblades he waves at ya'
Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water

Nothin' like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt?
There's no fun in that, here I come with ax
Fun to act like lumberjack, when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 911, someone's comin' in from the back

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake</p>

Hello, allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady, it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time, I'm sorry, I've been away so long
My name is Shady, I never meant to leave you

You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?

There's the necklace I lost right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll reroute, maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open Sesame mouth

Down the hatch, had the feelin' you can't match it
A rat-tat-tap on your door with the damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tackin' a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like 40 some Xanax's

Shortly come back, I'm tryin to score me some lap dances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so baby, pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back atcha

Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do was to just say hello
And are you menstruatin', baby? My lil' friend's waitin' to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin' and your booty's shakin' like jello
Well I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do was to just say hello

Yeah, my equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man, people gimme 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun

A 5th of rum and 2 bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn livin' room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name, Vivienne?
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um?

Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy, hun?
I'm lookin' for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is somethin' I'm tryna keep my penis free from

I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's, I'm fiendin' for some
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum

Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
Do ya happen to have anythin' on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good
Word, word, word, word, word, word, word
I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery

To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer gettin' them free, 100 bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's gettin' to be where he lustfully searched the den
Pain is hittin' his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him

Tirelessly on the phone tryin' to russle up
Muscle relaxants for his back and a couple of Pax's
Now he's doublin' backwards and he's stumblin' back
Slipped and fell, hit his back bone, heard somethin' go crack

Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back

Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
Do ya happen to have anythin' on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello

That's all I'm sayin'

Hello, allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady, it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time, I'm sorry, I've been away so long
My name is Shady, I never meant to leave you

Yeah, it's like startin' over, clean slate, ha</p>

Curtain Call
When I'm Gone
Introduction]
Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...

Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time
"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone"
But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice
"Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream "die Shady" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..

Chorus/Outro]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

My Name Is (Bootleg Version)
* this is the UNEDITED version with a different 2nd verse

Chorus: repeat 2X

Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is.. {scratches} Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is.. {scratches} Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second?

Eminem]
Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!

Chorus

Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup (Wsssshhhhh...)
Extraterrestrial, killin pedestrians
Rapin lesbians while they screamin: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'

Chorus

Eminem]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!) YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steamin mad (Arrrggghhh!) 
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Infinite
Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

Verse 1:
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Verse 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
I got to meet the fence fruit was stompin at your feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
My coil hands around this microphone lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Verse 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather led a tactful, tractical, track for your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tense to be tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...

When I was just a little baby boy
My Mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my Daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin', I'm playin'
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?

Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You god damn right bitch and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't 'Acid Rap' but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again

You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal' ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"

Know why I say these things?
'Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor

From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said, "Shut up", when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
Bitch I'ma kill you!
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why not?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"

I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you</p>
]

Yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh
I feel like dancing
I feel like dancing

I smell something in the air that's makin' me high
I said, I smell something in the air that's makin' me high

Okay, here we go, do re mi fa so, fa so la ti da so
Lyrical Rosco, give back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tic-tock song
Time to show you the most kick ass flow in the cosmos

Picasso with a pick ax, is a sick asshole
Tic tac toe frozen six pack, with exacto
Knives, stranglin' wives with big lasso
Few bags of the grass, zig zags, I'm with the Doc so

You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho

So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected nor what you thought so
About time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

Your dreams are getting' fulfilled, ooh, I'm literally getting' the chills
Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splittin' a pill
You're submittin' to skill, sittin' still
I'm admittin', I'm beginnin' to feel like I don't think anyone's real

Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Llama
And become a bin gramma, a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please, don't upset me, mama, you lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama

Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra toppin' the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row?

Put 'em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate

And which model, which lake they found her in
And how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun?
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryin' to light
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?

Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a Lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome

You're spinnin' drama when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the end enough
Capable of bringin' a Pulitzer, strong believe a bullet's a
Titanium, cranium that's full of surprises

When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evenin', this ain't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind</p>

Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back

Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back

I murder a rhyme one word at a time, you never
Heard of a mind as perverted as mine, you better
Get rid of that nine it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, thankful is jail

I used to be my mommy's little Angel at twelve
At thirteen I was putting shells in the gage on the shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Till I cut a kitten's head off
And stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey! mom! mom!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less

What do I think of sucess? It sucks too much press
And stress, too much zest, and breasts, too upset
It's just, too much mess, I guess
I must just blew up quick, yes
Grew up quick? No
Was raised right?
Whatever you say is wrong
Whatever I say is right

You think of my name now whenever you say "Hi"
Became a commodity because I'm W H I T E
'Cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'till Kim sees me
Now is it worth it?  Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips bitch, what?  My mouth isn't working?
You read this finger?  Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back , I'm back

That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back

I take each individual degenerate, his head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe

My name is Slim Shady
I've been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational
Back, it's the incredible
With Ken Kaniff who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff, on the internet
Tryin' to lure your kids, with him, into bed
It's a sick world we're livin' in these days

Slim, for pete's sake, put down Christopher Reeve's legs
Geez! you guys are so sensitive
Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it
Mind with no sense in it, fried, gets so frantic
'Cause eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin' lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin' out
All high and dosin' it
And that's where I get my name from
That's why they call me

That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back

That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back

I take seven kids from columbine and stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A MAC-11 and this oughtta solve this problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all of the time
'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy as this world was
Over this whole Y2K thing, and by the way
N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip-sync and buy a bigger size of ear rings?

That's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is making my ears ring
So I just throw up the middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this
Sorry Puff but I don't give a fuck, if this chick was my own mother
I'd still fuck her with no rubber, and come inside her
And have a son and a new brother
At the same time, and just say that it ain't mine
What's my name?

I am
Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back

That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back

Guess who's back?
Gue-gue-guess who's back?
Hi mom
Guess who's back?
Gue-gue-guess who's back?

D12

Fuck</p>
]

Yeah, woo, shit
Aight
Guess what? I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in a minute
Aye yo, this is my love song
It goes like this

Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And every thing's spinning, you're beginnin' to think
Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guiness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you
Get in your car, start it and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up

Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Look at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now, where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
17 years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However, I do show some respect to few
As ecstasy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, "Yo, what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I have got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you

But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna
Catch up sooner or later but fuck it, I'm on one, so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord so it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?

It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of the shit is gonna mean shit where we're going
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't

But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
To better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Haley while Haley's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me

Drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me
These drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me</p>

Yeah whattup Detroit?
Nu uh, nu uh nuh no he didn't!
Ahh! They didn't do it again
What what, wha what?
Did you shit on these niggaz two times Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sho'!
Uh uh, na, you smell that?
This is special right here
What what, wha what what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
Uhh, to the boogie oogie oogie
Yeah, y'know! What's crackin Dre?

Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
(Limp Bizkit)
Throw on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts
And watch mosh pits till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggaz from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central

Whoa, not these niggaz again
These grown ass ignorant men with hair triggers again
You and what army could harm me?
D R E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
  (Eastside!)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long UZ' and I carry it all day
(Blaow!)
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just bein Andre but I

Somehow, someway, hello, nigga
You know about Dogg-ay
(Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggaz up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin from the shit that I be spittin' son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang!

Damn baby girl what's your name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem
  (Whassup Slim?)
Whattup cuz?
  (Whattup Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope done hooked up
With the King of the motherfuckin West coast, baby!

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the head nigga in charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a twelve gauge about to bust

It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Aww naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the, heezy Baby
He's Sha-day!
He's so crazy!

Hahaha! Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a living
Off of the world's misery, what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me

I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you fagot
You happy now? Look here

I start some trouble everywhere that I go
(That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
('Cause they know)
I start some shit they throw me out the back do'
(The back do')
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo'-fo'
(A fo'-fo')

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Man, I need a lighter, man, right here
Yeah, whassup, Slim? What's crackin'?
Hit this shit, shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today
Is that right? What is it with motherfuckers thinkin' that

Because we're in the spotlight or whatever that
They can do or say whatever they want to us
And that we won't retaliate
Protect my motherfuckin' self
By any means, necessary, right?

'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Bein' underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight but seem to receive nothin' but hate

Millionaires snatchin' crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows
You know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home

But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me
(Yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin' for what so I can blow up
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?

Fuck that, this the fuckin' thanks I get
For tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down
(Upside down)
'Cause you seein' more support than I'm seein' my child

It's like everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin' this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her

Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence

And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it's unloaded full or an unregistered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
This clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it

And don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin' lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch

'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

This ain't business, this is personal bitch
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very fucked up day, I'm needin' this fit
Shuttin' motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the 5th

Yo Em, it's time to get serious with it
(Yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us

Ain't no love, lost my niggaz, relax yourself
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it, I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs, about my guns and my loved ones

Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano
Ridin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels

I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine

Sniff lines of coke that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit

So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?

Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
and one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place
Tryin' to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not

Gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it's a disgrace, Hailey can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn
Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' 'n' shit

Or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them

That if someone comes to my crib
I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
"Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans
Just for tryin' to stand on his porch"

And I'm the bad guy 'cause
I don't answer my door like "Hey, hi!
You guys wants some autographs?
Okay, form a straight line"

Sometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle
And climbin' the roof at night
And hidin' outside to snipe you

It's not that I don't like you
It's just that I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you</p>

** feat. Dr Dre, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Cashis, Stat Quo:]


It's not about lyrics anymore, it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

Eminem:]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Don't give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitz
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
We don't know a word to a verse,
All we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
Cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

Jay-Z:]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat
Than I'm gon feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
Its just the way the game go, oh, it takes 2 to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her "we in press heaven"
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable

Dr Dre:]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting cause ever since then it's been innocence
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
Its all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it's his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook

Eminem:]
(Wait Dre look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

50 Cent:]
Go shorty, its your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
Its the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into show, riding on lolo's
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo's
Don't fuck with the dodo's, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked
Look, its not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beep behind me player, so you here anyway
You don't hear what I'm saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I'll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

Stat Quo:]
There once was a time everywhere he turned
Shady aftermath was all ya heard
But they say 50 sang too much
And Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well fuck the fuck offs
All y'all eat soft, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
New syllables eat ball, ya fucks off's
Your house, your bitch I'm getting sucked off
East, south, midwest, even up north
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm running past while y'all walk

Ca$hi$:]
Shady made me for bringing it back
For the history of rap
It's gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap
What happened to just spittin about living in the muthafucking city you at
In the grimiest condition, I breath in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you could never be
Its a hitting, rhyme in the month deep
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Hear out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I'm Rosemary's baby

Eminem:]
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

*Talking:]
It is not about lyrics anymore,
It is not about lyrics anymore
Its about a hot beat, a hot beat
Its about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot hot hot beat
And a catchy hook
A hot hot hot beat
And a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow
Now get out there and sell some God-damn records</p>
]

Eminem:]
Good evening. This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of 4 million and a half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
Please undo your seat belt for take off
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

Dr. Dre:]
I'm Dre from back in the day from
N.W.A from black and the grey from
Chokin' a bitch to smacking her face from
Stackin' up bodies to racking their kids up from
Racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rap entertainment
Me and shady for us competition faggot there ain't none

Em:]
Speak of the devil
It's the attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from
Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon the great one
Wait it ain't funny man, It's urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun
And a emergency squirtgun to spray everyone

Chorus:]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you're now smoking with the best, the best)

I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you're now smoking with the best, the best)

Em:]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless,
A nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound
I surround the hydrants taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and vicodin
Before I begin to get so high pussy boy I could spin
Vin vin, Fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch girls of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
When you wake in the morning next to the porcelain

Repeat Chorus:]

Dre:]
Now where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's fire there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Em:]
Nah-ah he ain't playing,
He's gonna get the AK and aim it at your brain
I'm slightly insane, Vodka and creatine
Hypnotic and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre. get on the mic and make them tremble and shake

Dre:]
Now put your smoke up in the air
Raise your Henny and coke
And if you really want to get fucked up just let me know
We can smoke if there is no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You muthafuckers ain't smoking you just holding shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one

Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off puffing them trees

Em:]
Was luck enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up cheech
Come on smoke me up cuz,
Get me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady man come on back (what)
Man we're losing him, he won't even respond back fuck

Now look at all the pretty women in here (Dre: damn bitches)
Dre it's hot I think we better go check on their temperatures
I get the thermometer you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over this won't hurt a damn bit

Repeat Chorus:]</p>

B-Rabit 1st Battle



This guy raps like his parents jerked him,
he sounds like eric sermon, the generic version,
This whole crowd looks suspicious, its all dudes in here,
Cept for these bitches,
So i'm a german eh, thats ok,
You look like a fucking worm with braids,
These leaders of the free world rookies,
Lookie, how can 6 dicks beat pussies?
Talkin about shit's creek,
Bitch you can be up piss creek,
With paddles, this deep, your still gonna sink, 
Your a disgrace, yeah they call me rabbit,
This is a turtle race,
He can't get with me spitting this shit,
Quickity, lickity, shot, to squickity  split, lickity,
So i'ma turn around with a great smile, 
And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!</p>
]

You know I just don't get it, last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me? Ten million dollars
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'

Or leanin' out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is

Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets

And amidst all this Crist poppin' and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty six year old skinny Cartman

I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars

All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good-ol' fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin' and gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken?

New kids on the block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy-girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you fagots in public
I'ma love it

Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin', "I don't care, just bite me"

I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4 year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in fagots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer

Fagot to dope and silent gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' fagots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out

After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road, South of 10

And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim anus you damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming fagots

'Coz I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy I'll knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone, if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
It is fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?

The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC get bizzy

My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress

Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter your, fagot!
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass

So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins

A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house

And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see?  A picture of my big white ass

Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Here, double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

'Coz I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me

'Coz I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me</p>

There's no escaping
There's no place to hide
You scream 'Someone save me'
But they don't pay no mind, goodbye

You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin' and your in a
Nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner

Waitin' for you to turn the corner
So he can corner ya', you're a goner
He's on to ya', out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run, all you want is to rest
'Cause you can't run anymore, you're done

All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again

Swallowing the Calotapin
While I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn holding onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom

And make sure I got all of it, wake up naked
At McDonald's with blood all over me
Dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again, not again

It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em
(Killed 'em)

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon, I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana

Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall paneling
Dismantling every candle on top
Of the fire place mantle and grab my flannel
And my bandanna then

Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standing in my front window
If you look in, I'm just a hooligan who's used to
Using hallucinogens, causing illusions again

Brain contusions again, vutting and bruising the skin
Razors, scissors, and pins, Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who, gave these molecules to me

What am I gonna do? Hey, the prodigal son
The godfather for one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em
(Killed 'em)

She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I cut and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of a Jack

My last vic and a half, a flashlight up
Kim Kardashian's ass, I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member, December
I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin

I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinking tub
Cut him up into pieces and just
When I went to drink his blood

I thought I oughta' drink his bathwater that oughta' be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none

It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man
There's got to be one, oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up
(Up)

It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em
(Killed 'em)</p>
]

Yeah, oh, get up, I said get up, let's go

Better watch out, now, here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing
'Cuz we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone

Now first of all I'm the boss, I just wanna get that across
Man even my Dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows

Spray  painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him, if you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?

'Cuz you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?

She's got a tattoo of me right up off her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get up, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cuz we're havin' a White Trash Party

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from 'Night of the Livin' Dead'
And tomorrow I'll prolly still be too high to get outta bed

'Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot to kill like I'm hollerin' "Die Santa"
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders

So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cuz as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'

Makin' it rain for them ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's

From the north, east and west but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, cuz homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy, c'mon

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cuz we're havin' a White Trash Party

Now whether you're black, white or purple if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good, get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood

Now honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
'Cuz girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin

Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S, L to the I, M to the S, H, A, D, Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater

I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown, I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to unthaw, you feel me, yall?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall

But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cuz we're havin' a White Trash Party</p>

** feat. Jazmine Sullivan:]


Chorus: ~Jazmine Sullivan~]
Got to have it*
yeah I made it
I’m addicted
...

Verse 1: ~Eminem~]
This was a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
Starts off something like shady’s an insane maniac
Yeah slim shady that's a zany name ain't it
Now all you needs an image to go with the name, baby
Wife beaters and white t-shirts
Hanes mainly, its a long shot but is it possible
There's a lane maybe,
If not, he’s gonna have to come and change the whole game mainly
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it
He can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name feinting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole stadium
Joe smo made it, he took his plain jane lady
And his baby Hailey out the trailer
But he ain't trailing anymore he’s ahead of the race
While maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he’s about to be raped by this game

Repeat Chorus:]

Verse 2: ~Eminem~]
You’re operating on all cylinders
Syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts
People are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grillin’ ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya
But you can’t decipher why for the life of ya
It wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again
She found vicodin in your pants last night again
Your disputes public
Nothings private anymore
When your best friends say bye bye to him
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim
(But this is what you wanted Marshall ain't it)
Fuck no, the way that it turned out
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it
the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relation-ship
With another girl, this World is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world
Proceed, take another hit
Sniff til I fucking url
Tell em all to fucking sit and spin til they fucking twirl
middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then

Repeat Chorus:]</p>
]

A lotta people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now, haha

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Dre, I'm down here under the ground
Dig me up, broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
60 sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup

Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of oxy pads
Enough oxy cotton to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Whack job in a bag and a black stalkin' cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxin' match

He can't say that, yes he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
You better text message to your next of kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Throw a fuckin' lesbian in wetzy men

So faggidy, faggidy, faggidy, raggidy Ann and Andy
No, raggidy, Andy and Andy, no, it can't be, it can't be
Yes, it can be, the fuckin' Antichrist is back
Danny and Satan in black satin panties

This is Amityville, calamity
Goddamn it, insanity pills, fanny pack filled with zanies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk negligee, lookie

Razor blades with me to make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline make up layin' on the table with weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Six semen samples, 17 strands of hair
Found at the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe and canopy beds

And glad bags, yeah, glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch

Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicadin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lighten the strikin', might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th

That means is just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

So tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shootin' animal
Light up a cannon and have him catapult addin' a dog

Captain of the cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers

Hit Jason Voorhees with a 40
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in a fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture

Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' wiffle bat, Drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands, too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a triple fat goose

Insanity, can it be vanity? Where is the humanity?
And havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it

Cut your fuckin' head off and ask you where you headed off to
Get it, headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

So, it wasn't a choice, it was I had to do this
And now I got 90 days clean and that's all I have to share, thanks
Thanks for sharin', Brian, is there anyone else
Who would like to share this evenin'?

Yeah, I got somethin' to share
When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to

I won't have to rape you
So homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, down, down
Lay down, lay down

Where's everybody goin'?
This always went over real big in Gay A
Okay wait, I got another one
I just love condoms and lots of cum
No? Oh shit</p>
]

Sometimes I just feel like, quittin
I still mic, why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I just wanna jump on stage and just kill mic's
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of this stage fright, draw on the plane flight
Call but I might fall
It ain't my fault breaking my balls'
My insides crawl and I clam up
I just slam shut, I just can't do it
My whole man-hoods, just been stripped
I've just been picked so I must then get on the bus then split
Man fuck this shit, yo I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this ain't my room

I'm a man, I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to leave and just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these track man I'm a never look back
And I'm gone and I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Aint no followin footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from, this ain't my room

Walking these train tracks trying to regain back
The spirit I have before I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Trying to chase rap, gotta move a.s.a.p
Gotta get a new plan, momma's gotta new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the tv, buries her nose in the pad
And just colours until the crayon get dull in her hand
While she just colours her big brother and mother and dad
There's no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish that I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
Its like I grew up but I ain't grown up to nuts yet
Dont got a rep, my step, don't got enough pep
The pressures too much man I'm just trying to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry, yo I wont tell her why
Not a moment goes by that I look right at the sky
Please I'm begging you god
Please don't let me be fishin holding no regular job
Yo I hope you will be getting home, whereva you are
Yo I'm telling you dog, I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never to far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'm a be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this ain't my room

I'm a man, I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to leave and just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these track man I'm a never look back
And I'm gone and I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Aint no followin footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from, this ain't my room

You got to live it to feel it, you didn't then you wouldn't get it
Well see what the big deal is, why wasn't and still is
To be walking this borderline of detroit city limits
Its different in it, a certain significant of certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see but it's everything to me
Its my credibilaty, you never seen, heard, smelt a meda ta mc
Who's incredable on the same pedestal as me
The chaque still unsigned, having a rough time
Sit on the porche with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve mc's in the lunch line
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punch lines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow, where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another grabbing the bucket
Cause I ain't having no luck with this little rappers so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit
And it's cold trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this batteling mode
My defenses are so up one thing don't want it pity from no one
This city is no fun, there is no sun and it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like, I'm being pulled a-part
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
Its enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I just feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing I just blow my head as a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid, I don't got
But I learned it's time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Aint no callin her next time I need a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the word
Uh uh got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy hits the curve
Time to show these free world leaders, three and the third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the medium curve
Hit the burbs and run and see it's a blur, this ain't my room

I'm a man, I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to leave and just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these track man I'm a never look back
And I'm gone and I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Aint no followin footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from, this ain't my room</p>

(I don't know why this)
Yes man, as the world turns
  (World keeps turning round and round)
We all experience things in life
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
  (I don't know why this)
That we all must go through
  (World keeps turning round and round)
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)

I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
And light up like Jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
'Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source, yo
They never should've booted me out of reform school

Deformed fool, takin' the shit, now warn bulls
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
Oh my god it's you! Not again
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cuz I murdered my guinea pig
And stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers, and jackin' off in front of my counselors

Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin'
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is Phys Ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed slim fast
(Who me?)
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tanny's
And stepped on Jenny Craig

She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

  (I don't know why this)
As the world turns
  (World keeps turning round and round)
These are the days of our lives
These are the things
That we must go through
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Day by day

We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape
From their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
'Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage

It's almost dark and I'm still tryin'  to nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up, its nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat ya to a Bagel and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist

So gimme all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cuz you know your stinkin' ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day

And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her but so I gotta catch her first
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked

You might as well come out now
She said "Come in, its unlocked!"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her

I started to beg, "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death

{Come here bitch
Come here
Take this motherfuckin' dick
Bitch, come here}

  (I don't know why this)
And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
  (World keeps turning round and round)
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
  (I don't know why this)
And challenges everyday
That we must go through
  (World keeps turning round and round)

These are the things that surround us
Through our atmosphere
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Every day
  (I don't know why this)
Every single day the world keeps turning
Keeps turning
Keeps turning
  (World keeps turning round and round)
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)</p>

Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens

I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife,honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of them except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!

Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)

I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
  (Oh, shit)
What now nigga? What now, what are you doin'?
What?
Brewster Projects, nigga

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door
Somebody's lickin' shots off

Security's gone, I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my muthafuckin' gun
(Nigga, what about your wife)
Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm tryin' ta run and save my muthafuckin' life

Oh shit, the shooter's comin'
Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin'
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin' ta make it to the St. Andrew's door

That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tech
I don't see nobody but Fat Five and Hex

(Kuniva, you aight)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'

This chick is clingin' onto me, sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin' killed
So, I hugged her and used her body as a human shield

And she got hit, now, she yellin'
(Don't leave me)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not to late

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door
Somebody's lickin' shots off

(I been tryna call you all day, mothafucka, where you at?)
I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire flat

And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
(Shit, that's the clique we beefin' wit)
Man and I was on my way there
  (I swear)

Believe me, I'm leavin' my carcass today
I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door
Somebody's lickin' shots off

I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door, waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform

The fire marshals know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin' lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot

Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for, six feet away's the door
Into St. Andrew's hall, now, the strays flyin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall

Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin' a maseltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn, near shot it off
Thank God, I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun

And where the fuck is Von' he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
No I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was

I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her

Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet, I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it

And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door
Somebody's lickin' shots off

It's Friday night, came to this bitch, right?
Big ass to my left hand, Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cuz I'm poppin' niggas tonight

That's right bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka

So, one shot for the money, two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender, there's plenty of shots to go
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
He tried to run, so, Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door
Somebody's lickin' shots off</p>

Verse 1
I 'ma clean this whole shit out like climax,
with words put togeather better then sony electronics,
king of the jungle, humbly stay honest,
eat with the lions, swim with peranas,
gassoline the scene, strike the match,
inferno, I'm to throue nigga, so stand back,
I spit shine, get mine and rip rhyme
and make my career take a incline,
I'm strick with knives, straight with razors,
good with grenades and great with gadges, (yeah)
been around the world on a million stages,
watch nigga's bitch up and go through changes,
I had gun's before guns was in fashion,
I mashed out before niggas knew mashin,
I knew terror before the plane started crashin,
I got punch lines and nigga's aint laughin...

CHORUS

I'm gon be here after the smoke dye down,
Insomnia style I won't lye down,
fight the good fight don't need no help,
keep your hands up defend yourself,
move like I move and live lifelong ,
can't move up if your hearts not strong,
get your own shit cause this shit's mine,
every time I spit, I shine

Verse 2

cock-sucker I preach what I practise,
back shit up, wrap this, rap shit up,
still actin up, get found in the trunk of an Acuva,
yall suck like jail in dracula,
X turn up the heat, increase the hatred,
straight stone face don't fuck with gay shit,
so i guess that means I cant fuck with you now,
drew down, let off, facate to new town,
you feel like bishop, induced now,
gotta flame thrower that will burn
great holes till you goose down, (yeah)
rough sound, same strong background,
bent on black the big boys playin tips down,
my whole train of thought is the party,
any motherfucker with problems and not get caught,
I was blessed with life when I cursed to death,
I'm a spit till my very last breath...

(fuck yall)

CHORUS

Verse 3

Let me get a three second look, I hit a million dollar target,
You ain't came up yet well nigga' let me show ya, (aaaa)
Come across dope like planes and boats,
Like baloons filled with coke, down a mexican's throat,
you ever seen a man get smoked and shit on himself,
the body shake for a second, then it can't stop a second,
the evidence are the weapon and the people involved,
let one nigga talk, everybody gettin caught, for sure,
I say that, to say this,
if you cant handle the time then ride the beach,
might as well touch your tail and jump the fence,
castrate yourself expose the bitch,
X go head up, the fuck never ran from it,
I got engadged with buck shots that you can't stomach,
You ain't a killer you a album filler,
You ain't a soldier you a rap premoter,
Game over...

CHORUS</p>

Hi

Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling with a capital

Somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
(Hurry up)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her

I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said, "I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell

I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
(Yuck, yuck)

Hit you in the head with a brick til' you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til' you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, I don't feel it

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, do you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

I'm ice grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens

A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
Than a maniac, Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed

Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese, with my knees stuck together like Siamese

Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins, it probably all depends
On if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy, listen

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks)
I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, 'cause all I do is frolic and play

I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine

Scratched my balls til' I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS", forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows

That don't even make sense, like dykes usin' dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded

My daughter scribbled over that rhyme
I couldn't read it, damn</p>
]

People!  It feels so good to be back
Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the new
And improved, you know who

Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the center piece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can a bitch don't want no beef with Slim
No! Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From sÃ©ance to sÃ©ance

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back
The Boogiemonster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do si do, oh yo ho, hello there

Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins, hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their navy

You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin their food and their baked beans
I'm twenty-eight, they gon'
Take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane, or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic hypnotic product, I got it the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk a lotta hum de lay de la la
Oochie walla walla, um di da dah da dah but you gotta gotta
Keep movin, there's more music to make

Keep makin new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry, like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny, I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pass the KY
Let's get ready for some intense, serious ass fucking!

(Dr. Dre)
Wants to square dance with me
(Nasty nas)
Wants to square dance with me
(X to the Z)
Wants to square dance with me
(Busta rhymes)
Wants to square dance with me
(Cana bitch)
Won't square dance with me
(Fan a bitch)
Won't square dance with me
(Canada bis)
Don't want no parts of me
Dirty dozen
Wants to square dance with you
Yee haw</p>

Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time

I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha"

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show

I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time

I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha"

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time

I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"</p>

Is this thing on? Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back? Back again

Just the Two of Us (Radio Edit)
Just the two of us.. (8X)

Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!

Just the two of us.. (4X)

Yo
I can't sing it I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing 'cos I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Some days I sit starin' out the window watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cos sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps gettin' older I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cos they don't understand me
They just don t see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

Sometime's it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cos sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she come back to me

Yeh and if I could sing I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her how proud I am that I got her?
God I'm a daddy I'm so glad that her mum didn't abort her
Now you prob'ly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cos there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder that gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin' should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife who's determined to make my life livin' hell

But I handle it well given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances man it's too bad coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin' three felonies six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people' backs bent over backwards for this woman
Man I shoulda seen it comin' why'd I stick my penis uppin'?
Woulda ripped the pre nup if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it it's over there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby maybe the only lady that I adore Hailey
So sayonara try tomorrow nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
Its like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted

Now it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cos my baby knows that her daddys a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

I told you I can't sing oh well I tried
Hailie remember when I said
"If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what? Daddy's here and I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you"</p>

Hi!  My name is.. (what?)  My name is.. (who?)
My name is.. {scratches} Slim Shady
Hi!  My name is.. (huh?)  My name is.. (what?)
My name is.. {scratches} Slim Shady
Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second?
Eminem]
Hi kids!  Do you like violence?  (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?  (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?  (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?  (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate  (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh!  "So why's your face red?  Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut!  (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!
Chorus
Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers  (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they screamin at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do  (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her  (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans  (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'
Chorus
Eminem]
Stop the tape!  This kid needs to be locked away!  (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die  (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!)  Am I comin or goin?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive?  (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!)  Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk  (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks  (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM?  (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS!  (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  (BANG!)
I'm steamin mad  (Arrrggghhh!) 
And by the way when you see my dad?  (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had
Chorus</p>
]

There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone-lines, can't dial out
I scream for police but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
There's a Doberman, Pinscher and a Pitbull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit fooling with me

Quit fooling with me
Bitch, you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
And which you're gonna see in the long run
I'ma be the wrong one

You wanna harass with this Limo tinted glass
Flashin' that flash-light on my ass, where was you at?
Last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass
Rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass

They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm posed to fight with bear palms?
Yeah, right
They coming with bombs, I'm comin' with flare-guns
We as Americans

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means

We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans

I'ma make Vuku bucks wearin' Vuku vests
Drama hanging over my head like a Voodoo Hex
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
But you know who with an S tattooed to my chest

But I've innested, now I got the Industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker
Than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty

Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said
But I said precedents and the standards
And they can't stand it

My name should've been bastard
The shit should've been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it

I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit
I done seen a fastest rap shit
And turning into some pap-pap shit
That quick, snap click
But this time they got fucking automatic
And no one gon' test this mon, clack

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means

We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans

I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
Under my Long Johns, under my Sean Johns
When running with the long arm or the long long gone

I'ma do five years or less than that
No questions asked
It might be a good idea to stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared nipped on my head

A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gone send a task
I ain't gone even ask, they ain't gone let me pack
They ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my whizz at

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means

We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans</p>

{*scratched sample*} - "I'm the man!"*

I stand in, ?? by the way as i begin
Do you know who I am? and may reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being ??
Why should I be secluded, I got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?"
So I find myself in a certain ??depligatory??
A place where I dwell in, ?? for some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, ??
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim like a reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? the hatred is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn, it pages left to be read,
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one

{*scratched sample*} - "Yeah", "It's another..

There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
The world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling
"Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you tryin to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
The outcome we want ?? nothing ?? despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless and
You're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverence of a starchild
Rest with formidable talent and versitility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infridge on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refuser abusin it's accepted now it's a trend

{*scratched sample*} - "Yeah", "It's another..."

You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No? so then why do you speak for me 
and every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But I've ?? apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now see it being re-enacted
Pull up the ?? quick,
These ?? we hate him, these ?? are past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to proove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And ??bluffing?? with nothing to say, stutterin and slurrin
And mutterin words with no meaning, attack me side I'm like ??Danny K/Danny Kane??
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
and eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving

So I'm out the game huh?
Huh? {*echoes* Yo Dre, WE RIDIN?
Whatever
Haha! Well I'm witcha homies
Okaylet's handle the small shit

I was born to brew up storms and stir up shit
Kick up dust, CUSS 'til I slur up spit
Grew up - too quick went through too much do too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk the shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
{*Poof* And if I fumble the verse, keep goin
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled no punches that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll EAT shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

Creep wit me, as we take a lil' trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
(But what about Jermaine?) Fuck Jermaine
He don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think, I don't read
Your lil' interviews, and see what you're sayin
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, Mini-Me with a bunch of little Mini-Yous
Runnin around your backyard swimmin pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven-year-olds

Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie Cup, if you ever mix me up
Or CONFUSE ME with a Canibus or Dre with a DUPRI
We'll rub it in, every club you're in will have you
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't havin itlong as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate

If there was some magic shit
I could wave over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would

If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn'tnot even if I could

From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered

And I'ma only sucka punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
Cause I know if they get up I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a FUCK! White 'Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill'
And grow up, to be Atilla, go nuts and be a pillar

And I'm, somethin of a phenom'
One puff of the chron', I'm unstoppable
I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (come on!)

Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin all day
But I handle my business cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin it your way {*clack*
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
And you die tryin to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilatedeyes dilated

Heh, like my old lady
Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, dependin on your mood if it swings
Think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed rightand my looseleaf's my launchpad

And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, and invest
In somethin to protect your head and neck

And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source? Ain't holdin my fuckin breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I'll breathe to collect a fuckin check

Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?

Watch your fuckin mouth

Yo this Timbaland, tell them I said suck *chka* MY dick</p>
]

Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the TriBeCa
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector

I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I buy sex and erect ya'
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya'
I tantalize ya' and in less then 5 seconds I get ya'

They say once bitten and twice shy
Well, I'm next to the guy with 9 ecstasy pills and 5 extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities
Why? Yes sir, I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser

That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess, I'll dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

All my West Side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, quief and blow it up
Man, I think that Eggers fell off the tip, didn't show enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up

Man, you've seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no, you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole, you kiddin'?

I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I'll do what I wanna
Spray perfume in a sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man who would've thought I

Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man?
Grab a hold of this branch with both hands
Man, they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
This name rhymes with so many different words, geez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please

Eminem, I'm coming to kill you
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

The world is mine</p>

I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're mean yo mean yeah man

You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo?
Hippity ca-ca boo-boo

Psych, I'm kidding
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
Ok, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because

You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now, aww shit I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't, it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay
You're droolin', you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting

What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'n' Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on truth syrum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It's my own insecurity

You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth

This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me
Lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this
This is torturous my point is this
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, your just is

You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie

But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie

Fuck off my dick, heheheheheheium</p>

We should do something like that

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice

Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is hip hop when it's in it's

Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is

And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex a chainsaw and an axe

Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack

Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Drezy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track

In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass, 50 Cent

Nah, 'em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass
The clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks
The Fif'll tell you're ass apart

A came in this game
Crush a motherfuckers from tha start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy
Fifty crazy rich, bitch

Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows

You're rockin' with the kid that spit sicka sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and 'cause a maylay

Turn the town upside down wit a frown upside down
I smile through sumthin' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, go 'head, funky funk up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, it's the re-up

We're drinkin' it's been a couple of days, since I've slept
My dick is sore from fuckin', when I bust there's nothin' left
Just dust, back on the stage, give me my microphone
Strappin'(?) with the audience as we perform hypersong
Our label presented us with a plaque
Brought it on stage, and bashed it to pieces with an aluminum bats, stanks(?)
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause

Yeah, definitely, definitely, definitely dawg
Definitely, definitely k-mart
Yeah, yeah

You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw a line on any fences
If so to what extensive
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say that I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this

Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship and it's down right blasphemous
Listen to shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator

Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed Superman
And how ironic? That I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite, the green chronic

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse and it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after preforming the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases

That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre?
(What up?)
I gotta question if I may?
(Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend
(Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off?
(Yeah)
But, ut! I ain't done yet

In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney but he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where is the goddamn beat?
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it

I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon a
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and screw my
Head is straight back to the Neverland ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I don't gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man

'Cause I
Yo, rain man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre, super dope beat maker
Two thousand and two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy</p>

People, it feels so good to be back
Mosh with me now

You scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'ma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a father-less past

Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin' and jugglin' both
Perhaps mastered his craft slash entrepreneur
Who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure
Movin' past that Mr. 'Kiss his ass crack'
He's a class act, rubber band man yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form this stomp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
No matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same 'cause no matter the weather

If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now, more then ever
They tell us, "No", we say, "Yeah", they tell us, "Stop", we say, "Go"
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, c'mon, just

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on

Imagine it pourin', it's rainin' down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryin' to tell us somethin'
Maybe this is God, just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward that we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this
Without pumpin' our fists, now this is our final hour

Let me be the voice, and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it and multiply it by sixteen million
People are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a high anarchy
Strap him with a AK 47, let him go fight his own war
Let him impress Daddy that way

No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare to trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, its all lies the stars and stripes have been swiped Washed out and wiped and replaced with his own face
Mosh now or die, if I get sniped tonight
You'll know why, â€~cuz I told you to fight

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on

And as we proceed to mosh through this desert storm
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ as we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army to disarm this weapon
Of mass destruction that we call our President
For the present and mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard, Mr. President, Mr. Senator</p>

Nail in your Coffin (part 1)
Comin up it never mattered what color you was, if you could spit then you could spit, that's it, that's what it was. Back when motherfuckers was straight back packin' syphron fightin' for life in this rap for the mic to get passed, and you phsyiced and your gassin, and you hyped cause you lastin, and you might win some massive, if you lost then you lost, shake hands like a man and you swallowed it. Went on some hype column in the source was like my only source of light when the mics use to mean something, the four was like you was the shit, now it's like the least you get 3 and a half now which means yous a peice of shit, for and a half or five means you Biggie Jigga Naz, or Benzino. See I don't even think you realize you playin with motherfuckers lives. I don't watch Greg get fucked on the chronic probably cause i was on it. Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide, I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breathe to get a five, shit I was right I’ld a fuckin died already tryin' I swear to God, I never lied. Tell us why you and that bitch gave me that bullshit review, I sat and took it, and look at the shit we knew, you try to fuck us with obby in 52. hhhkkkk pewww, fuck a relationship we through, no more source with street credit them days is dead, Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays' head.. Every issue there's an 8 page makemen spread. Will someone please tell him whoever braids his head I am not afraid of this fuckin wastin lead on my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple. So listen closely, cause I break it down and proceed, this oj's 'bout to get smoked like row weed. You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother you motherfuckin' punk. Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell you little sell out mag., I ain't mad I feel bad, here's an ad here's a poster of Ray Ray and his dad. You want to talk about some shit you don't know about, yeah, let's talk about how your puttin' your own son out there to try to eat off him, cause you missed your boat, cause your never gunna blow bitch, your just too old. No wonder your sore now, lordy your bored now, I'm pushin' 30 your kick 40's door down. Business is war and you'll never beat me, all you do is cheat me, out of cordables, but you know you'll always see me, on your little tv, cause you got to stay up to 3 in the mornin' to see your video played once on B.E.T. So, hehe he, who has the last laugh after mad gas, you won't be half of a whole stack. Kiss her asshole cracks, you'll never fold or whole back, just know that. Benzy knows whack, no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow jack. Your better off tryin to bring R and Soul back, look at your track record, thats how far it goes back.. It's extortion and rounds of portion, so half of the staff affair fresh out of jail from Boston. Bullyin' and bossin', gave like a slave, they completely brain washed him, and forced him to stay locked in his own office. Afraid of the softest vaguest wanna be gangsta in New York. And it's pitiful cause I would of never said shit if you'd kept your mouth shut bitch now what. Here da clue, spit it Slain, new shit, exclusive your landin and yo who get, you know what to do with this use it, I'm through witdis, this is stupid, I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this, and who you callin a bitch...bitch. You owe me.</p>

** Remix, Extended Version; feat. Obie Trice:]


*10 seconds instrumental]*

Intro: ~Eminem~]
Yeah!

Obie Trice:]
Obie the person that came up and deverted
Cause of nervousness. - That was solely the homie's verdict.
It was worth it cause he changed, became so I observed it,
Certain such of a purpose.
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain.
That's why there's curtains in his murder if you gettin' worked up,
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher.
I had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doin' the same in school.
Now look what he became! A fool,
Cause he learned how to sustain his two and obtain fame from you?
Living hard, but still Julliard
A god walks in but ain't spent a day in a pew.
Regardless of this, I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents,
So welcome to the art department.

Eminem:]
I stimulate the brain, mimick, emulate a saint
Cynic keep 'em thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't.
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, suck "Your-anus"! (Uranus!)
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say
He may seem as though he's plain normal if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say.
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say,
So he's vague. - So they mistake him for just bein' crazed.
You part ways, your impression of him changed; you don't think he's strange?
You turn around and tell him: "Peace and thanks."
Then you catch him flippin' you off with his pants down, hands around his Scrotum,
Tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs. (AAAHHH!)

Obie Trice:]

Eminem:]
It's all psychologic. - Why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick? (bllabllablaaabbbb!)
Or am I truly psychotic, or are my molecules just diabolical?
Cause biologically - I defy logic.
By golly, haul me off on a trolly
Pro'ly want a crack, I'm back on that wacky tobacco.
I'm a step away from Crack, Obie smacked the shit outta me!
I'm so slap happy, man. Snap me back to reality!
I'm a walkin' art gallery. - A science museum.
Elephantiasis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see 'em!
I pull em out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance; I can't just put 'em back in my pants. (HELP ME!)</p>

Our House


Here's the story, of a little boy.
Growin' up in a suburban home,
Tying to cope with everyday life,
Who lives in a little house,
That was built, in the middle of the street.

"Hey, Mom!
Tupac's on the juke box,
somebody shot two cops,
and raped a little girl,
while two dudes watched,"
"Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him,
You wouldn't have Two Pack Shaker,"
"No! That ain't how you say his name, ma!
You're so lame,
Don't you know anything?"
"Yeah!
I know that you'll probably go,
and join in the gang,"
"Yeah, right.
Where's my fuckin' walkman at?"
"Stop cussin' at me!"
"Shut up, bitch!"
"And quit talking back."
Well,
Slammed the door and I'm out,
Now, what?
It's probably warm in the house.
Fuck, I forgot my jacket,
forgot it was winter.
I'm gettin' thinner,
I'm hungry.
Is Mom cookin' dinner?
"Mom!
Let me back in!
I forgot my coat.
Mom, come on, I'm not playin',
It's cold!
Alright, sorry.
I need a jacket,
Mom, look,
My Tupac tape,
I just cracked it,
Mom, please let me back in,
It is Two Pack Shaker,
I just asked him."
I'm freezin', (achoo)
I'm sneezin',
I'm breathin' too much cold air,
I'm wheezin',
"I ain't did nothin',
I ain't say "I'm leavin',"
I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin',""
(scissors cutting)
"Alright, here.
Take your damn coat and leave,"
"Fine, I'll leave,
Mom! You cut off the sleaves!"

(Chorus 4x)
Our house,
In the middle of the street.

One, two, three,
My teacher's two faced,
She went to lower my school grades,
Since Last Tuesday,
I had a toothache,
from kool-aid,
So Mom kicked me out, (get out)
And, all i had in my suitcase,
Was one shoelace,
A tube sock,
and a tube of toothpaste,
Sometimes,
It was cool,
"cause I could go to a friend's,
Crash there,
Fool around and just skip school.
But other times,
I'd rather just be home,
In my own room alone,
Read my shit and nobody would know,
My little brother sucked on a bottle,
'Til he was six,
So I'd hide it inside the couch,
And say "I don't know where it is,"
But as soon as Mom found it,
I would either be grounded,
or kicked out the house,
a thousand week,.
and still countin',
Even when I was underage,
Mom was tellin' cops,
I was tryin' to run away,
I told her,
"Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay,"
Please, Mom, Please, Mom, Please, Mom,
I wanna stay, (let me stay)

(Chorus 4x)

My brother's incoherint,
Mom's a single parent,
Who ain't carin',
Starin' through me,
Like I'm transparent,
Made it clear,
That I was just there,
to run an errands,
Told her friends,
I was a son from her last marriage,
Sent me up to the little corner store,
with a note,
"Please, sell my step-son,
Some cigarettes so I can smoke,"
One time,
I tried to fake sick,
To get attention,
Back-fired,
Mom, sent me to school,
With a vengence,
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me,
I go to class,
and every teacher's always laughin' at me,
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at.
Not only that,
She heard me upstairs,
I can't rap,
and I'm stupid,
I never make an average,
of a B+,
I need to sit on my ass and sue people,
Like she does,
One time, I got food poisin,
From a hot dog,
Mom sued and got $2,000,
From Ballpark,
"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"
"I don't think so.
Now keep an eye on your brother,
I'm goin' to bingo."
"But, Mom. You said you were broke."
"Who said?
You got your ears messed up,
from that damn rap music."

(Chorus Fades Out)</p>

Nail In The Coffin


Eminem]
This motherfucker here, just wont shut up will you? 
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me 
I'm promoting you right now 
Man lets put the nail in his coffin 

Chorus]
I dont want to be like this 
I dont really want to hurt no feelins 
But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap 
Old men have heart attacks 
now I dont want to be responsible for that so 
Put the mic down and walk away 
You can still have a little bit of dignity 

verse 1]
I would never claim to be no great Benzino 
an 83 year old fake Pachino 
So how can he hold me over some balcony 
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me 
Please dont, youl probably fall with me 
and our asses will both be history 
But then again youl finnally get your wish 
cuz you be all over the street like 50 Cent 
Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump 
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up 
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up 
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck 
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin 
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin 
and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearences 
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists 
dont even respect you or take you serious 
Its not that we dont like you, we hate you - period 
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn 
last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand 
Now hes a busta? What the fucks with that? 
Get on a track dissin us kissin 50's ass 
and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me 
bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me! 
What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man 
ready to take whatever sentence he hands 
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists 
right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl? 
And I put that on her, when this is all over 
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her 
I dont know shit about no shoppin rocks 
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots? 
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin 
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin 
them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos 
Just makin copys of your covers of casette singles 
and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer 
Spendin your whole paycheck at Disc Makers 
What you know about bein bullied over half your life? 
Oh thats right, you know what thats like, your half white 
Vanilla Ice,spill the beans and rice, Im eaten you alive inside 
Jesus Christ, if your that much of a gangster, put the mic down 
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now 
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill'em dead bitch 
Shoot'em in the fuckin head, go ahead bitch 
Slap my mom, slap the f*ck outa her! 
She cant sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you 
Cuz your broke as fuck you suck your a fuckin joke 
If you was really sellin coke, well then what the fuck 
you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack 
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap 
You never had no security, you'll never be famous 
You'l never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it? 
Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens 
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this 
and Canibus they usin too many complicated fuckin words for you 
Here then let me slow it down for you 
so you can understand if I say it slower: 
Let it go dawg it's over 

Chorus]

Eminem talkin]
Haha 
Talkin bout I have motherfuckers callin your crib 
bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib 
You aint even got a fuckin phone, fuckin bum 
Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin Source magazine 
if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first 
take it like a man and shut the fuck up 
and fuck your little magazine too 
I dont need your fuckin magazine, I got XXL number anywayz 
And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin bigger than yall 
oh, and by the way, howed I look on the VMAs? 
When you was watchin me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin me from in 
Boston 
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin sissy 
Like you got us scared in the motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin dicks 
Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo, the Source has a 
white owner</p>

Chorus X2

I just wanna love ya

Eminem]

Theres a certain mystique, when i speak
that you notice that sort of unique
cause you know its me, my poetry's deep
and im stillmatic the way i flow to this beat
you cant sit still
its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
im strapped, just knowin any minute, i could snap
im the equivelent if what would happen if bush rapped
i bully these rappers so bad, lyrically
it aint even funny, i aint even hungry
it aint even money, you cant pay me enough
for you to play me, its cacamamy
you just aint zaney enough, to rock with shady
my noodle is cockadoodle, my clock is cookoo
i got screws loose, yeh the whole kit n caboodle
im just brutal, its not rumour, im numeral uno
assume it, theres no humour in it, no more you know
im rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
you better love me, bitch

Chorus X2


50 Cent]

My boys is crazy in the hood,
they holler my name
if it aint about the flow its bout the stones and the chain
if i was you, i'd love me too, i roll like a boss
911 porsche, same color as cranberry sauce
i aint goin front, i thought r kelly was the shit
let me find out, he fucked around with bow wow bitch
niggaz eatin popcorn, right rewinding and the tape
now shorty momma in the precinct, hollerin rape
im convinced man, something really wrong with these hos
i thought lil kim was hot till she started fuckin with her nose
i used to listen to lauren hill, and tap my feet
then the bitch put out a cd that didnt have no beat
that boy d'angelo, hes determined not to fail
that nigga went buttass for his record to sell
my back shots are help ashanti hit them high note
and big ben taught charlie b moore to deep throat

Couldn't remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff from Connecticut
He said his predicits and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said "I like you"...and then he walked up and said "Let me snake bite
you!"
And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe...
Gave him a elbow...Ayo Proof ...go....

Proof]
Yo it's the D to the 1 - 2
What you wanna get done to...
Your chest plate...eradicate
Get your flesh ate...easily done..Here it is...
Freestyle...no need to write shit...cuz when we write shit
Y'all like to bite shit...that why street light up when we write stuff
It's time to be the champions at this...it's D-12
1-2 True crew...Slim Shady and Big proof
Knockin over Igloos in Alaska when we blast ya
A massacre creator, one time for data
Darker than Vader...go anybody hot as the equator
It's time to get down one time for those that dont know us
Girls wanna blow us like Monica....Lewinsky
Come against me...

Eminem]
Go and see I'm an invincible Mc
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passanger side...
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin mental illness a gentle stillness...
Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew ? You don't smoke brew...
If you do I'll choke you and then I garauntee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too and i can stick my dick in a bitch and poke you....

Proof]
Stick it in there....rock with my cock on sky rock
Knock ya eye out the sock...(sock)

So don't get in the way cuz we gon drop....(shit)
Now how you feel right now we bust yo..op....(tic)....(tock)
We lunatics with mics and we dont stop we come to rock
The dirty dozen is non-stop..
To the top from tree tops to ewoks that pop Reeboks
And men with pre-ops
Yo now there is 3-Pac's
Master P....Thug Life and now it's 2pac
Get back to that one...here goes the rhyme that you dropped...

Eminem]
The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you
You can even give it a dumb try...If you're a dumb guy then come try this
But I rock the microphone with my flyness
So get off my jock..get of my cock..when I sky rock ...it in sky

Proof]
Ayo...a lot of people always try to tell us...that we gona be better or 
failrues

Eminem]

And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at

Proof]

Y'all dont want none of tha dirty Deez
&gt;From the 3-1 its for the three of thirds
One third Mc yo we smoke y'all like herbs
Under the curb early morn take it to born 
Y'all get broke up...put back together ...re-enacment
Some times you see this...you just a faggot
No need to tag it...wit more loot that Jimmy Swagart

Eminem]
Faggot....uh oh...was that homophobic...
But no one knows it...and I'm so homophobic 
I wont even throw clothes in the Closet
Fuck it...I've lost it....I'm holocausted...see my face it's written all

You're so fired you're down

Proof]
Hey....it's me...it's the hamster man...
Coming all the way from Amsterdam....
And I come to tell you all a little secret.....
So you can ........eat it ....you got to grab your crackers
{mumbling}

Eminem]
Quit spittin your writ shit bitch I'll kill you and kick you
In your motherfuckin dick and your clit...you little pussy
Hermaphardite with no apettite
And you aint rappin right but you was taking rapid bites
Of my dick when you was on it...my brain is haunted

Eminem]

Hellbound


Announcer]
Welcome back, to the stage of history

Eminem]
Yo.. Slim Shady!
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse 
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal 
I ain't tryin to shoot you, 
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while I sit back and just hope it catches 
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)]

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray everynight (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

Chorus 1/2]

Announcer]
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

Chorus]

J-Black]
But every time I take a step, it gets dim..
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
Haha..

Time's up!
You lose!</p>

** feat. B.o.B:]


Chorus: ~Eminem~]
There's no need to say shit you already know*
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Verse 1:]
Holy toledo it's Angelina Jolie amigo
She told me yo Shady just hand your penis to me I'll deep throat
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see bro
Who was a fantasy I don't mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna rassle I shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed lexapro broken up with the capsule or paxil
Just incase I ain't dope enough with the raps though
Coke is cut with tobacco
Smoke it up then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco
Shady let go, the hoe has been choked up enough
Let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson let's go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I'm off my fucking meds but I'm on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jasons face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar
They can't even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I'm gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cause

Chorus: ~Eminem~]
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?

B.o.B:]
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, geez
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down?
And I will never let up?
(I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better)

Verse 2: ~B.o.B~]
With the soul of a Sharman
I leave the beat than vomit
Like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It's probably go diseases on it
I'm just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
Somebody tell these girls please release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin' back watching Earth from my Space station

Chorus: ~Eminem~]
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Verse 3: ~Eminem~]
Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bendingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotising like I gotcha
I gotcha pychologically fucked
I would like an apology what
Tell that psycho to stick a tyco and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I'm as cold as a motherfucking icicle on my nut
I ain't nuttin' nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post tramatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I've been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don't paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning
(He can't say whore)
Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

Chorus: ~Eminem~]
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better</p>

One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous wake-up show

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin' holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box

Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk, snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up

When I woke up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali locked up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'

This Big Tech from the Midwest, leavin' MC's lipless
On the Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper

Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway &amp; Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9NE's filled"

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
'Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows
(Where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout

"Hey that's my couch, bitch", pull a nine out during a rhyme 'bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin' a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down

You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway &amp; Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold

'Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech &amp; Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh

So the head won't fall off, hauled-off, sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
Oh, huh, C now like Omar Credle, we pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech &amp; Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play

When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK

Tearin' your neck away
Flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of Jake investigate

What? Sway can give it to you but whatcha gon' do wit it?
Tech can give it to you but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you but whatcha gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what?

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought

The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell

You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg

I'm Wake-Up Show reppin' wit Sway &amp; Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin' wit the Tech &amp; Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets, I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt

You gotta be willin' to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway &amp; a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway &amp; Tech do

I'll be back but for now just sackle
Fresh, for ninty-nine you suckas</p>
]

Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me, Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica
Wait a minute, you hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other

Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together, I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No Roger, that's not what I want to do
I love her! And we're going to be together
Never</p>

Yo, yo…
Your style is generic, 
mines authentic made,
I roll like a renegade, 
you need clinic aid,
My techniques bizarre and ill, 
I scar and kill,
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill,
And I proceed to cook and grill ya,
That’s all it took to kill ya,
You betta recognize me like I look familiar,
You wanna battle? 
You beat around the bush,
Like you’re scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush,
I need a clown to push, 
someone that I can bully,
Wait a minute, 
I don’t think you understand fully,
See me without a style like mustard without the Heinz,
I lead the new school, 
you' re a 'busta without the 'rhymes',
I'll crush the shit out ya lines,

Oh that shik sheiky
smokin dat leak leaky
ten freaky girsl 
inside the Chin Tiki
girl when u see me u betta believe me
this aint a game n
pimpin aint easy
anything goes when it comes to hoes
im the kingpin when it comes to flows
u betta ask someone if u dont know
when u see a girl say, "What up doe?"</p>

Intro:]
Yeah, yeah, I get it*
I run this rap shit, now guess who's back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)

Verse:]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20′s still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!</p>

(I never knew I)
(I never knew I)
Mic check, one two
(I never knew I)
Who woulda knew?
(I never knew I)
Who'da known?
(I never knew I)

Fuck, what a story
(I never knew I)
Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I)
And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk, when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn 'em around

Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me, when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row
Screamin, "Go", with their seventeen year old uncle
I'm like, "Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked, if they liked violence?"

And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make up you allow, your twelve year old daughter to wear?
So tell me, that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
And 'Fuck' was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird

So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch, I never knew I'd

Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby de doo wop
Skibbedy be bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me?
And run up in the school shootin'
When they're pissed at a teach

Her, him, is it you, is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought?
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

How the fuck was I supposed to know?</p>

Life by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down

What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins

Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel

Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wanders why I'm smartin' off

I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while I'm on the John
If I had a million bucks it wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on

Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM
Tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum

Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns

Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs

Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks it wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit telling me to be positive
How am I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'? I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything

Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word</p>

Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S
Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right
To the rap mobile, let's go
(Marshall marshall)
Bitches and gentleman
It's show time
Hurry, hurry step right up
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is
(Marshall)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you
(Marshall)

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is back

Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges

Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of nine one one, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy Bat Syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals

So, skip to ya lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was till everyone knows the shit

The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing

Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival

Come on
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already know who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero

You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set

Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so levy?

Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg for sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me

'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here

Yo Dre
Whuddup?
Can I get a hell yea?
Hell yea

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea

So there you have it folks
Marshall
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because
Marshall
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall
So until next time friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall
Oh hah</p>

Tell myself that I was doing alright&lt;br /&gt;
There's nothing left to do tonight&lt;br /&gt;
I go crazy on you, crazy on you&lt;br /&gt;
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can't you see what you do to me baby?&lt;br /&gt;
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac&lt;br /&gt;
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick&lt;br /&gt;
You're truly the only one who can do this to me&lt;br /&gt;
You just make me get so crazy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic&lt;br /&gt;
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanna sex&lt;br /&gt;
You make me crazy, the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sack&lt;br /&gt;
We fuck like 2 jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'Cuz the next day we're right back at it in the same exact pattern&lt;br /&gt;
What the fuck is the matter with us, we can't figure out if it's lust&lt;br /&gt;
Or it's love is what's attracting us to each other&lt;br /&gt;
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch&lt;br /&gt;
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today&lt;br /&gt;
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you&lt;br /&gt;
Just 'cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby&lt;br /&gt;
Because you stay with me, maybe, 'cuz you're as crazy as I am&lt;br /&gt;
'Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes&lt;br /&gt;
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises&lt;br /&gt;
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators&lt;br /&gt;
And dildos, you fuck yourself so much, you barely feel those anymore&lt;br /&gt;
You're only 24 but you're plenty more Incomprehensible]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sure than those other little hoes who just act like little girls&lt;br /&gt;
Like theyre in middle school, still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'&lt;br /&gt;
You play your position, you never step out of line&lt;br /&gt;
Even though I stay in your business, you've always kept out of mine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wonder what's on your mind sometimes&lt;br /&gt;
They say love is blind&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye&lt;br /&gt;
You ain't see the sign&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love&lt;br /&gt;
I go crazy on you, crazy on you&lt;br /&gt;
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad&lt;br /&gt;
The moral, the very fiber the whole substance to my rap&lt;br /&gt;
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence&lt;br /&gt;
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much&lt;br /&gt;
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do&lt;br /&gt;
You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire&lt;br /&gt;
You're my entire supply gas, the match, and igniter&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs&lt;br /&gt;
To my table, if you were to break I'd fall on my face&lt;br /&gt;
But I am always gonna make you feel I don't need you&lt;br /&gt;
As much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But you are essential to me, you are the air I breathe&lt;br /&gt;
I believe if you ever leave me, I'd probably have no reason to be&lt;br /&gt;
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you are the Slim to my Shady&lt;br /&gt;
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Haillie&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are the word that I am looking for when I'm trying to describe&lt;br /&gt;
How I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind&lt;br /&gt;
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me&lt;br /&gt;
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are like the root to my evil&lt;br /&gt;
You let my devil come out me&lt;br /&gt;
You let me beat the shit out you&lt;br /&gt;
Before you beat the shit out me&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And no matter how much too much is never enough&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love&lt;br /&gt;
I go crazy on you, crazy on you&lt;br /&gt;
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you</p>

Em, what's goin' on?
This is Paul Rosenburg here, faithful attorney o' law
Listen, I er, listened to the rough copy of your album

And uh,  you know I just gotta be honest with you
Could you turn it down a little bit?
Because there's only so much I can explain, give me a call</p>

"hey ..  yo...   "

Chorus (2x)]
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..

Verse]
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck 
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go


Chorus (2x)]
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..

A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on records
Or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
Or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why?
'Coz I'm a

Criminal
Criminal
You goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's, "Yes"

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin'
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em

Hey, it's me, Versace, whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the 'male'?
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?

C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an Amen
Amen!
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons

Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither

You can't teach me a goddamn thing ause
I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts

And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new cd for these fuckin' retards
Duh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't Give A Fuck, still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'Coz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess, I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'Coz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess, I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went, when the President got oral sex
In his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as
Eminem and Kim combined, the maniac's in
Replacin' the doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place

Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look, uh huh, just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waitin' on you
Aight
Yo Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awright, goddamn, fuck

How you doin'?
HI, how can I help you?
Yeah, I need to make a withdrawl
Okay
Put the fuckin' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
Don't kill me, please don't kill me
I said, "I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you"
Hurry the fuck up!
Thank you!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal
'Coz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess, I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'Coz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess, I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'Coz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess, I'm a criminal

** feat. Just Blaze:]


Chorus: ~Just Blaze~]
Some people ask me, where I’ve been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
I play in the background, I don’t back down
So don’t get it twisted, tryn'a play me
First I come out, they underate me
Then I come back, still try to fade me
They say I’m nasty, say I’m crazy
Ask what I think, I say maybe
I fly away
It ain’t nothin' in my way so I may aswell fly away
It ain’t nothin' else to say so I may aswell fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today
Cos I’ve been to the top and there’s nowhere else to go
The only way to see me is if you lookin’ up from down below
And there’s nothin’ else to say so I may aswell fly away
And there’s nothin’ in my way so I may aswell fly away
I’m on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away

Verse 1: ~Eminem~]
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I’ma step up on the stage now, I’m gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt
And you aint gotta tell me notin’ boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don’t stink, I dont think so
Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll
Are you ready now, here we go
The bald eagle has landed
I’m back in ya hair, sorry for leavin’ you stranded
Im twice as dread and evil and rancid
They cant sit, I don’t think anybody understands it
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough
I aint got to play though, they say I died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it’d be a trailer not a car
The white trash star
I fuckin RV up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, your dippin your soup inside ya crackers
I can carry rap til my back hurts
Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors
Get my back right
Now I’m right back on you bastards
I was chasin’ the dragon, I dont know what happened
It was like the feelin’ I had when I first started rappin’
I just could’nt seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab, thats where I’ve been at when...

Chorus: ~Just Blaze~]
Some people ask me, where I’ve been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
I play in the background, I don’t back down
So don’t get it twisted, tryna play me
First I come out, they underate me
Then I come back, still try to fade me
They say I’m nasty, say I’m crazy
Ask what I think, I say maybe
I fly away
It ain’t nothin’ in my way so I may aswell fly away
It ain’t nothin’ else to say so I may aswell fly away

Verse 2: ~Eminem~]
I took a hiatus haters now I’m back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
Im the *bang* you aint fuckin sick
The hospital won’t even give you cough drops for course cocksucker
You think your hot, you aint even luke warm
My pubes hotter than you
Your soft I use fire to cool me off
I told em I’ll grow up one day and show ‘em I’d be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightenin’ bolts and throw ‘em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgie porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for em
Make ‘em swarm, make ‘em fight over the shirts I’ve worn
Sworn over my sweat towels, its mind blowin
Yes I'm livin’ the dream homie, can't nothin’ compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in mid air I’m lovin’ it yeah
Its like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters is so pussy they’re afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe ‘em back pay
They spat in my face, now I’m back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste,
And slap it back out, before I step back out of this crap thanks
Slap me now I’m slapping ‘em back hey! fuck it we’ll slap back
But yeh okay now we’ll talk cause I’m smack ay
And I aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack
How’s that for hindsight, what the track say?

Repeat Chorus:]</p>

I never meant to
Give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to
Bring you to my world
And now you're lying
In the corner crying</p>

Look at me, hip, I'm Britney Spears,
Look at the way I wear my mascara,
How you doing,
I'm Pristina Gaguilera,
And I sing songs about a genie in a bottle,
And I'm Britney Spears,
I got big tits,
I'm a role model,
To all little kids,
But i got breast implants,
That was the only way to get my chest enhanced,
And here I go with the lyrical, miracle, spiritual everytime im incredible,
With freestyles from the top that I drop,
And my instinct,
Is to kill NYSNC*,
And the Backstreet Boys,
It really doesn't matter coz' I got a scratchy voice,
Yo, check it out,
But you ask me I ain't gonna be happy til' I see every member of the Backstreet Boys,
Getting their ass beat,
In the back seat of a taxi,
And dropped of on the real backstreet,
And somebody black sees five little rich white boys,
Looking like faggets,
With the inword painted on the back of their jackets,
ohhhhh,
And god damn it,
Can't stop there,
What's up?
It's over,
And this just Shove Mcardy and Mountain Dew,
And wonder how we tune is,
Ten million</p>

Comin' Out My Closet (parody)



Intro]
Where's my penis?
I have no penis in my butt hole - there you go
Yeah.. yo, yo


Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been penetrated and ejaculated against
Rammin’ shafts up my faggot ass, look at my brass
Ever since class I’ve been suckin’ off my teachers to pass
All this cum motion unloadin' run deep as ocean's explodin’
Nut keeps splashin’ from faggots just suck 'em off and keep goin’
Nut-takin’ bummer I’m known as to every one in my region
Keep stickin’ ass in the mornin’ and takin’ cocks in the evenin’
Leaves me with a taste as sour as seminal in my mouth
See they can bugger me, but y’all never figured me out
Look at me now; you know I got a dick in me now. 
Blame my momma?
She was the fattest slut in the house!

Chorus: 
I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm comin’ out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm comin’ out my closet


Ha! I got some vibrators in my closet
and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '83
before I ever had to worry about the HIV
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father used to put his willy up in my bum
cause he split, my anal cherry then he came in my eye
And lookin’ back on it all now I fuckin’ wish I could die
I look at gays, see, and try to picture their bare behinds
Even if I hated men , I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
to make it work with ‘em, at least for papa's sake
He maybe made some mistakes
but he’s the only gay who taught me everything that I know today
What he did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit he did was put a condom on his king dong
’Cuz he'da killed me; shit he woulda shot cum in my throat
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Batty Boy Show"

Repeat Chorus 


Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin’
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessin’ your momma gobblin’ Mormon missionaries in the kitchen
Bitchin’ that someone's always pullin’ down her drawers and clit's itchin’
Goin’ through public whorehouse systems, victim of crack-controlled pimpin’
My whole life I was made to believe I was straight when I wasn't
'til I grew up, now I do what you did, I’m sick to my stomach
guzzlin’ it
Wasn't it the reason you gave that VD to me MA?
So you can try but can’t deny the way you treated me MA?
But guess what? You're gettin’ Alzheimer’s now, brain dead and alone too
And your care home security’s gettin’ lax, you’re gonna know when I bone you
My asshole’s gettin’ so big now; you should see it, it's beautiful
But you'll never see it – ‘til I shit on you at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is when I take cocks that are long
Rips through my thong - keep tellin’ myself its all cuz’a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I fought fuckin’ long and hard for these dicks
Remember when Elton came out gay and you said you’re glad it’s not me? 
Well guess what, I +AM+ gay - gay as a faggot can be!

Repeat Chorus (2x) till end</p>

** feat. D-12, Obie Trice:]


Tupac Shakur:]
Get on your knees nigga
Get on your knees and pray, haha

{Scratching}

Ja Rule from +Loose Change+:]
Em you claim your mother's a crackhead and Kim is a known slut
So what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up

Intro: ~Eminem~: talking (Hailie: echo)]
A ha
Yeah
C'mon, G-G-G-G-UNIT!
Hailie (what?)
Come here baby
Bring daddy his Oscar (okay)
Where gonna shove up Ja Rule's ass laughing]

Verse 1 ~Swifty McVay~]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to Murder Inc. with lead and I ain't talkin about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claimin you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch), you a replica guy (*gunshots fired*)
If he was still alive, you would never get by (for real)
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real
Life is more than imitatin niggaz and eatin pills
And what kinda motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin, you a brother gettin cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin on his color cause he need it
(2Pac: Get on your knees and pray)
And all you niggaz hatin, shut your mouths
It's just the real niggaz ain't buyin that shit y'all put out

Verse 2: ~Obie Trice~]
Doe Rae Me, but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc. do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin less than R &amp; B comin from that regime
Regime, is a little extreme
That connect some soldiers, motherfuckin Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave our witness team on the TV screen
Chased the greed, now that you embraced the green
Don't fuck with them triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor slash Pac impersonatin rapper
Slash Billy Holiday, how it happen?
Artists and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed 'em
Told 'em reenact 'em, you go platinum
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy
Jeffrey Atkins reenactin her boy
So I'm click clackin the toy, mash and destroy (*gun cocked and fired*)
Shady slash A`ftermath in Detroit motherfucker (*gunshots*)

Chorus: ~Eminem~]  {w/ ad libs}
Doe ray me, you fly so latte da, don't blame me
Cause you washed up, lost your spot
I'm a stay on my side of my crusade
Ja quit playin, knock it off you're not Tupac
Don't hate me cause you hot and your not goin at me
The only shot you got
Ja quit playin knock it off you're not Tupac
And get popped like all that shit you pop

C'MON!

Verse 3: ~Kuniva~]
Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
'Til the grievance and the cryin and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga, you shook
You half of a halfway crook
Get off X's dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin old ass ignorant innocent lookin senior citizen
Built up slap you like Grandmas all sensitive
Wait a minute hold on (what's up?)
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on (*laughing*)
A bitch "Made Man", now how you gonna connect
With those short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggaz could scream holla and curse
Go ahead, respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

Verse 4: ~Proof~]
Slim didn't send Proof to get into +Wankstas+
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stuckin your Bridgestones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept (bitch)
When the talk get nonsense to walk in bomb threats
Contacts was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threatin at the boss you gonna see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggaz heard and they ain't scurred to bust

Verse 5: ~Kon Artis~]
Yo, props to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster get jabbed in the tonsils with dicks
So much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya?
Cadillac Pac or the transvestite that dressed like a Lil' Kim fox
Your chest like a little wooden box
When I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right all the little shit you got left to help you eat
Your not Pac's souls, without laws we'll help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryin to mock Pac
You Mockaveli, get your own idea (*gunshots fired*)

Repeat Chorus:]

Eminem: {Talking over the Chorus}]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin punk, pussy, bitch
I'll fuck you up boy
Never, never in your motherfuckin life
Smack the shit out you little motherfuckin midget
Hailie will whip your motherfuckin ass

Outro - Obie Trice -Talking}]

Hailie:]
Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me?

Eminem:]
No honey you guys are the same size</p>
]

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'

What I do through and through and I give you the news
With a twist, it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade; you been afraid, I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they

Pop toasters and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies, niggaz crotched over
Mommy's knocked up, 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown, when Child Support knocked

No, he's not around now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day

How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you lose your tie and your shirt

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it

Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it

Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict like you didn't experiment?

Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage

And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go he's jigga joint jigga chk jigga
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss My Ass

It's just a renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to talk
About anything, anything, anything, anything

Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at, any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to holler
About anything, anything, anything, anything

I had to hustle my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in

By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Doo-rag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefter often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home

Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown, 'specially on nights
I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up

Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these latter day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist

But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today

See, it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons
Take a bath with the Catholics in holy water
No wonder they try to hold me under longer

I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful, eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers

'Cause I'm a muh'fuckin' renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to talk about
Anything, anything, anything, anything

Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to holler about
Anything, anything, anything, anything

Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to talk about
Anything, anything, anything, anything

Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to holler about
Anything, anything, anything, anything</p>

I'm a goat*
And for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
It means the greatest of all time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes!

This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's telling me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky (haha)
Like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's making a stink about me
Like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers
And the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
Why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-z
Please, be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's
The only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowing god damn well that I'm one of the best god damn rappers that ever lived period

I'm a goat
and I don't mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen
man, I thought I was crazy
or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Wall's white
cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
and Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
because he's so caught up in that snow white
that Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
he's so gone off that coke, right
and it's so sad, cause he's dope, right
America's next great white hope, right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right
and which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
they said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
and I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"
and I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that
but these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
but I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
when suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me must've died
thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
and (?) God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
and Angelina Jolie is just another ho
and Brad is a sucka' because once I fuck her
she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
you know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you want a Shady? Well, you got it, man
I ain't apologizin' for shit.

I'm a goat
and I don't mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
shit is too easy
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
(I'm a goat)
so don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
but y'all know that
(I'm a goat)
and like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
but before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start
and thank you very much to everybody who was
and y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know
(I'm a goat)
(hahahaha)
I'm out, y'all
it's been real, peace</p>
]

I told ya'll mothafuckas I was comin' back
(Oh shit)
What now nigga, what now?
(What are you doin'?)
What?
Proof, the projects, nigga

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

Security's gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my muthafuckin' gun
(Nigga, what about your wife?)
Nigga fuck my wife, I'm tryin' ta run and save my muthafuckin' life
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'

Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin', people shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin' ta make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even DJ House fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex

(Kuniva you awright)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'

This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she's yellin'
(Don't leave me)

I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38, I hope it's not too late

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

(I been tryna call you all day, mothafucka, where you at?)
I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes

(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
(Shit, that's the clique we beefin' wit)
Man and I was on my way there

Believe me I'm leavin' a caucus today
I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform

The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin' lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot
Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off

Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
Into St. Andrew's hall, now the strays flyin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face, another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off

I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazel tov
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von, he usually tucks one on him

Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
No, I guess not, what the fuck, oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife

There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet, I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it

And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

It's Friday night came to this bitch, right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cuz I'm poppin' niggas tonight

That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka

So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender
(There's plenty of shots to go)
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off</p>

Wahoo, guess who's back?
Mommy, we're home
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody, put your hands where my eyes can see

Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was 50
Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does

From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages

And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it

'Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit

And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from unverified] be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes and clears out

And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all 'cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's 'bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is 'bout to go off

Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin' sprayed
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

It ain't about hip hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

Step off my holster 'cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?

Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks

If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches till there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb

Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

About to change, 'cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin' sprayed
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

It ain't about hip hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip hop, this function is where did it
When I put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it

Got you stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamor
When you enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit

We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to save hip hop the task is something greater
'Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters

Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

About to change, 'cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin' sprayed
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

It ain't about hip hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911</p>

I told y'all motherfuckers I was comin back, oh shit
What now nigga, what now? What? Brewster Projects, nigga

One shot, 2 shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm tryin' to run and get my motherfuckin' gun
Nigga, what about yo wife? Nigga fuck my wife
I'm tryin' to run and save my motherfuckin' life

Oh shit, the shooter's comin'
Bitches hollerin', niggaz runnin'
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin' to make it to the St. Andrew's door

Hey man, that's the sound of the glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forget my tec
I don't see nobody but Fat Five and Hex

Kuniva you aight? These niggaz is trippin', where's Bizarre at?
I'm tryin' to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggaz is whylin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'

This chick is clingin' on to me, sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But it's real and it's on and caps is gettin' peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield

And she got hit and now she's yellin', "Don't leave me"
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late

One shot, 2 shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

I been tryin' to call you all day motherfucker where you at?
I'm on 7 Mile, what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back
What with they car? With a gat nigga and my tire flat

And I just hit a pole, them niggaz some hoes
Is you hit? I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi, shit, that's the click we beefin' with
Man, I swear and I was on my way there

Believe me, I'm leavin' a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up

One shot, 2 shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door, waitin' in line still
Tryin' to get inside the club to see D12 perform

The fire marshalls know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
And some cumwad from out the parkin' lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot

Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aimin' for, six feet away is the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flyin' all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face

Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off

Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck?  Oh my God, it was

I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her

God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop D, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it

And made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezin' his four-fifth

One shot, 2 shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off

Yo, it's a Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggaz tonight

That's right bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryin' to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker

So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender, bitch bring me a bottle of Mo'
I just wanna know who drivin' the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

One shot, 2 shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off</p>

8 Mile Freestyle vs "Lickty Spilt"



Lickety Split]

This guy's a choke artist
Ya catch a bad one
Your better off shootin yourself
With Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin up this mountain your weak
Ill leave you lost without a paddle
Floatin shits creek

You ain't Detroit, Im the D
Your the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks
Fuckin Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music

Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin foolish 
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his asscrack
And when you actin up thats when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

Ill crack your shoulder blade
Youll get dropped so hard 
Elvis will start turnin in his grave
I dont know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile
To the trailor park

Rabbit]

This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
Its all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So Im a German, Eh
Thats ok, you look like a fuckin worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies

Talkin bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek 
With paddles this deep
Your still gonna sink
Your a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit
This is a turtle race

He can't get with me spittin this shit
Wickedly lickety shot
Spickety spickety split lickety
So Im gonna turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!</p>

8 Mile Freestyle Pt.III vs "Papa Doc"



Now everybody from the 313 
Put your mothefucking hands and follow me
Everybody from the 313 
Put your mothefucking hands up
Look Look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not had his hands up
This free world got you gased up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none

This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
I know everything he's got to say against me,
I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob who shoots
himself in the leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl,
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't ever try to judge me dude 
You don't know what the fuck i've been through

But i know something about you
You went to Crankbook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrased?
This is guy's a gangster, he's real name's Clarence

And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
'Cause there no such things as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Crankbook

Fuck the beat, i go acapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly 
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty, 
Here, tell this people something they dont know about me.</p>

'Cuz I'm gonna kill this bitch
Yo man, what? I don't know, I gotta

We wait till she comes out
And then I'm gonna fuckin' kill her

The fuckin' clip is empty, man don't point

Gets out car, oh shit, come on</p>

(Miscellaneous Lyrics)

CHORUS
My friends have told me
It's all around me
The signs of you guys
Being there too
I know it might be
A little Crazy
It's true without it
You wouldn't be you

I miss the times when we were
About 10
We used to run around
Play around
It  was happier then
I still know you guys now
But you're not the same
I used to like it when
Our lives were a game

REPEAT CHORUS

I've got some new friends
You'd really like them
I can't help but
Think about when
The games were over
Into a uniform
Still inside me
The thought of you is warm
I really miss you
Wanna hug and kiss you
And

REPEAT CHORUS

The time is messing up
I feel like dressing up
It makes it harder
To realise it

REPEAT CHORUS (X2)

I really miss you
Wanna hug and kiss you
It's me and you

B-Rabbit Vs. Diffusion
this silly rabbit dont like leathers I heard he like dicks
Fagget niggaz, with ponytails and lipstick
I'm for real, dont give a fuck, what, what, ohh
its like this, eastside is where I'm from, you got beef
hit me on the streets with a badge and a gun
fuck the badge, I'm comin through with a black mask
about to do this b-rabbit nigga cause he a fag, like I said
earlier in the clause, I stated that in my, oh shit (laughter)

B-rabbit:

aight look, I can see that I’m put to the test,
battlin this chick, with no breasts
and why I got to battle a chick, especially one thats wack, wit a dick
so you a dope MC, don’t get mad and start takin your period out on me
cause I ain’t done shit to you, whats your name diffusion,
well I guess I gotta confuse you, this ain’t something I’m use to, 
why the fuck did future even introduce you
I really dont understand why this chick is up here right now,
and wants to be a man
on this mic is rat-a-tat-tat, why the fuck am I standing here battlin the brat
you dont really even wanna see this, on this microphone I wont eat your fuckin fetus</p>
]

This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit

The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid

I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin' like Boone's Farm
Hidin' under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms

Connivin' Kon, Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin', "Let's get it on"
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin' a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint

It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin' your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music

You know why my hands are so numb? No
'Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't come, oh
Smacked this whore for talkin' crap, bitch
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap

I fuckin' hate you, I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you, hell yeah
Satan done got me on this song
Eatin' a hot dog readin' the Holy Quran while I'm on the John

Tired of wearin' this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs, thong, thong, thong
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms, fuck your love songs

This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit

The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid

Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump, click-clack

The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaw
Have you runnin' out this fuckin' club in your drawers
We lovin' the broads, there's nothin' to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in The Source, it's fight music

I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin', "You hear that?"

I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin', came back and fucked up
His pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin, it's fight music

These beads I'm swingin' is stingin' 'em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club, I'm bringin' 'em
If any nigga lookin' too hard, we Rodney King 'n 'em
Malice green to them and gasolinin' 'em with premium

Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin', right when your wife's lookin'
Fuck fight music, bitch this is losin' your life music

If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit

You Liberace's, Versace's and you Nazis
Watch me 'cause you thinkin' you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed as you pop me

I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise 'em 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me

And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to and it's called

This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit

The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid, it's fight music</p>

Chorus:]
Put it on my wee wee!*
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange! (4x)

Verse 1:]
Got a dick, it's as big as a banana
I try to control it, but I can't.
It's too tough, it's like an AK flip banana.
You better watch out, Hannah Montana!
Man, what's the matter? Have you no manners? (no!)
You know the girl from Juno's address?
Yeah, I'm a prob'ly go to jail for that.
Now I got the cops on my tail for that!
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that.
It coulda been a Molotov Cocktail for that.
Wait a minute, man! What the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you goin'? What are you, bananas?!
You can't go back there, stupid ass!
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Krueger mask.
Who the fuck are you, Superman?
All you have is a little stupid can
Of whipped cream what the hell you gonna do with that?
I'm a put it on my wee wee. Ooh, good answer!
A super bonanza extravaganza.
Man, go ahead, what you waitin' for?
You better get them clothes off, baby boy.
Come on! Let's go! We're gonna make a porn!
Ready, set, go! Hit play, record!

Repeat Chorus:]

Verse 2:]
Are you ready? - You better hold the camera steady.
She's pro'ly back there with a damn machete!
She's pro'ly gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's pro'ly gonna kill ya; still wanna check, see?
Have a little quick look? - Go on?
She's pro'ly six foot tall like bigfoot, the hell with that?
We probably should run, don't dare look back!
We probably, probably, probably
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did ya?
Now what ya gonna do when she gets ya?
I ain't goin' with ya, forget ya!
Quit tryna hold my hand, mista'!
Pretend she's your little sista'! - Little sista'! ?]
Might as well take the whipped cream with ya
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture!
We could try to make another "Blair Witch-a - movie"
A beastiality porno with smoothies.

Repeat Chorus:]

Verse 3:]
It's Eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
The "Beauty And The Beast", his back is hairy.
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very.
No, Zack! Don't go back in there!
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair!
He screams: "Bloody Mary! " - Grabs a mirror
But stop just ain't in her vocabular.
"Get off me, please! Get off me, stop! "
Ballin' back at a coffee shop.
They go non-stop. - She says: "Go! "
He says: "No! " - She says: "Oh! "
Back and forth, they scream and shout.
Yeah, boy; let them demons out!
It's the kinda nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh! Now the whipped cream is out.
I get sick thoughts. - Sick, sick, thoughts.
The things you could do with your lipstick gloss.
Put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange.
Bitch, keep going! - Bitch, keep going!

Repeat Chorus:]

Outro:]

Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our shit, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly shit
You know what I'm sayin', some get high shit
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy shit, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that shit he be doin'

You ain't into fuckin' drugs, fuck you
You don't do ecstasy, fuck you
You don't pop mushrooms, fuck you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, fuck you

I'm Nauseous in this place, I need some office
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him

In ten seconds I'm go in to turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tell me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his ass
When he's taken his ashes and flickin' 'em

I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
Aight Mr. Mathers pick 'em up
No you pick 'em, bitch, stick 'em up

Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this shit no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office

Fagget, fuck you, work at the post office, fuck you
Talkin' shit to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' dick, fuck you
If you're a white rapper, fuck you
Talk shit about stretch your cool

But if you don't talk shit about stretch, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' punk, fuck you
Talk shit about me, fuck you
You wanna battle me, fuck you
I ain't got to say shit to you but fuck you</p>

Check check, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2
(It's rolling)
Yeah yeah yeah, Dr. Dre up in here
Y'all know what this is
It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby
Yo Eminem, show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam

I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication

But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation?
(Come on)
Anyway I got down with Dre
(What up?)
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray

Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the Police"
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
(Fucking baby)
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo

Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't
'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image

You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
(Wanna Fight?)
I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling

A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm juss high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady

Dr. Dre
I'm drunk pass the tec

'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych I'm just joking for Christ sake
Don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends

Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own
sometimes I can't find it at home it hides in the stove
(Hello, where you at?)

Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter, fuck you lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes

The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base

Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it

But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old

'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do</p>

Encore
Never Enough
Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me
Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

Chorus x2] Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I end up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough

50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

Nothing Can Change This Love
If I go a million miles away
I'd write a letter each and every day
Cause honey ain't nothing, nothing
Can ever change this love I have for you!

Make me weep and you can make me cry
See me coming and you can pass me by
But honey ain't nothing, nothing 
Can ever change this love I have for you!

You're the apple of my eye
You're cherry pie
And oh you're, cake and ice cream
Oh you're sugar and spice
And everything nice
You're the girl of my dreams!

If you wanted to leave me and roam
When you got back, I'd just say welcome home
Cause honey ain't nothing, nothing
Can ever change this love I have for you!

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
That nothing, nothing, nothing
Could ever, change the love I have for you!</p>

Am what's up?
Steve Berman, what's goin' on man?
How you doin'? Good to see you again
What's up?

Am could you come in here and have a seat please?
Hmm, yeah, what's up?
Venessa shut the door
Okay

So, what's up? How it's odd lookin'
For the first week
It would be better if you gave me nothin' at all
This album is less than nothin'

I can't sell this fuckin' record
What?
Do you know what's happenin' to me out there?
What's the problem?

Violet Crayon told me to go fuck myself
Who's Violet?
Taylor records told me to shove this record up my ass
Do you know, what it feels like to be told
Have a record shoved up your ass?

I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rappin' about big screen TV's, blondes, forty's and bitches
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicada

I can't sell this shit
Either change the record or it's not comin' out
Now get the fuck out of my office
What I'm I supposed to?

Now
Alright man</p>
]

Yeah, ya know? Critics man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know the one thing I notice about critics, man?
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'mma tell 'em

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the 'dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go

Flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin' a spider in the snow
So ya better get to blowin in flow rider
Inside of a low rider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the hoes?

Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't gob this is a blister in the salt
Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost
Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws

And cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws
Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
Your on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick, I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit

You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire

I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook the for a song, look
This ain't a song it's a warnin' to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, your a fuckin' flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan
Mr Mathers is the man

Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy
And stash it in a can, come back and whip your ass with it again
Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand it'll eat through
Anything metal the ass of iron man

Turn him into plastic so for you to think
That you could stand a fuckin' chance is assanine
Yeah, ask the nine man, hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon

Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van and hop out
At a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand

So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage you ain't never seen the brew
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a belemic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut boo

Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick don't nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare

I'm wastin' punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it save it, psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair

You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so hot my motherfuckin' firetrucks on fire, homie

You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, your on fire
You're on fire</p>
]

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate

Start off with the NyQuil like, "I think I'll just have a taste"
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, "Yeah, that's great"
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight

Now, I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
"Mommy, something's is wrong with Dad I think"

"He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car
Eating 'Three Musketeers' in the rear seat"

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I tried but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?
That's the devil in my ear, I been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fuckin' hear
"Marshall, come on we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"

And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine

Yeah, I know but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out 'cause I didn't feel the ground at all

Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover? And goddamn I've got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I tried but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die

Oh ya, there's an excuse, you lose proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?

Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now you see the reason how come he

Has taken four years just to put out an album B
See me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
It was bologna, was it the methadone ya think?

Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide, ain't it? So you can lie to Haley
 I'm going beddy, bye Whitney baby, goodnight Elaina

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I tried but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why I just don't know</p>

Invasion (The Realest)



"So let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?"

scratching] What is this? what is this? 

Intro]
The Invasion! (Invasion yeah)
Green Lantern! the infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)

Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice!
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!

Verse: Eminem]
Whoa, here we go, I shoulda' known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
"Stomping in my Air Force Ones"
But you won't be able to tell 
If it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink 
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the Eminem vocal scratch]
Wit a pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy

Chorus: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records
We the label fa' sho!

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records
We gon' kill your label fa' sho!

Eminem]
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months gun cocked]

Outro]
Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't 
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
Cause we do and we see y'all
We just gon' sit back for a minute 
While I see what the FUCK y'all do</p>

** feat. F.B.T., Eminem:]


And everyone should get along..*
Okay children quiet down, quiet down
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady

Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got aids!)
Good luck Mr. Shady

Eminem:]
Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom

And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock

When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge

'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker

Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her

But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you

Chorus: ~Mr. Mackey~ (Eminem)]
See children, drugs are bad (come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along)
Drugs are just bad, okay?

Eminem:]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world

If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids two hits will probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back

Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper drive
And his eyes roll back in his skull
His back starts to - look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'

And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money

Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you

Repeat Chorus:]

Eminem:]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off,
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it

Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair

(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus

Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!)
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)

But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't,
'Cause I'm bad for you

Repeat Chorus:]

Mr. Mackey: ~Eric Cartman~]
Come on children, clap along (Shut up!)
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God dammit!)

(Mushrooms killed Kenny!
(So, fucked up, right now...)</p>

I don't know, man, just feels like we're a lot different
Kinda feels like we're on a whole different page right now
It feels strange but um, I guess it's kind of like, it's kind of like

I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin'
That's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphin's I effect

Your self-esteem shatters as dialect
Comes blastin' out your deck, she loves me
Such a passion, you'd expect this sort of reaction
From her yet

You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny
You try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop, The Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one

I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, c'mon on, son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, "She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some"
Homeboy, you better get a clue, she's on my dick
'Cause she I spit better than you

What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' her diggin' her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction, yeah)

She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and you're not, aw

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboys helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up

'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations, aw
That hater alarm is soundin' off, man
Obama took the bomb from my name, aw

So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame, aw
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And thangs just ain't been that same since that day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction, yeah)

It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-a-war with your ear
You hear it, girl, come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premier

Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle that'll wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you're losin' her
Oh wait, you don't like it when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out?
Let me slow it down some

It's still gonna be a blow out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk but none of it's fuckin' with me

Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit
You think you're killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin' these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Mashall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awestruck
She's love stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick, aw, fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, till I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work

For me, it just wouldn't be sufficient enough
'Cuz we are just gonna be enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree

There ain't gonna be no reason speakin' wit' me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speakin' Englais
So we gonna beef and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh

And settle this face to face and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D-12 and thanks but me need no help

Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony

Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all you, Ja, you'll get it too

So go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die, time's up
Bitch close ya eyes
(Uh)
Go to sleep, bitch
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?

And go to sleep bitch
(What?)
Die mothafucka die, motherfucker
(Bi Bi, Bi Bi)
Go to sleep bitch
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why die, die mothafucka, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

We got you niggaz, nervous on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MC's, you's worthless
You's not them G's, you's a circus, you's no appeal, please
You's curtains you use words cool heard slurred in two thousand third

You's purpin', you's no threat, who's ya servin'?
We lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth

And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse

And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the deaths

Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

So go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die, time's up
Bitch close ya eyes
(Uh)
Go to sleep, bitch
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?

And go to sleep bitch
(What?)
Die mothafucka die, motherfucker
(Bi Bi, Bi Bi)
Go to sleep bitch
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why die, die mothafucka, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin' New York wit' the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit' my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sweet

Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one that started the fight

He be knowing how dog get, when dog gone bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'Cuz it's all good, it's all right

Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line and we can go track for track
Damn dog, why did you have to do them niggas like that?

So go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die, time's up
Bitch close ya eyes
(Uh)
Go to sleep, bitch
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?

And go to sleep bitch
(What?)
Die mothafucka die, motherfucker
(Bi Bi, Bi Bi)
Go to sleep bitch
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why die, die mothafucka, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch, uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
We're killin' all you motherfuckers dead, all you
Fake ass gangsters, no more press, no more press

Rot, motherfuckers, rot Decay, in the dirt, bitch
(Uh)
In the motherfucking dirt!
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, ha, ha</p>

{B Rabbit}
Word, I Think you were a little hard on the beaver

This Guy keeps screaming he's paranoid

Rob bidi bli blob de rob bidi blo blob

Hipidi hoo bla

]

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted

Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
"Murder murder Redrum"

Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated, till my stress is elevated
How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?

Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er

Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin' Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didn't Ya? Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dip shits
Doing whip pits, passed out like Sanford snip pits

Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum

But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich

Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch, what the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips

Slap hips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in

I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging

Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like "Oh, this is good, who sing this?"
Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit

It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing

Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP

Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix

Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from</p>
]

And everyone should get along
Okay children quiet down, quiet down
Children I'd like to introduce
Our new substitute teacher for the day

His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that
(Shut up)

Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia
(He's got AIDS)
Good luck Mr. Shady

Hi there little boys and girls
(Fuck you)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
(Huh?)

Say hi Bob
(Hi Bob)
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot

And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks
(Ahh)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops

The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off

But Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a Dr.
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her

But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you

See children, drugs are bad
(C'mon)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad
(Ask him man)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom
(That's right)

She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
(She will)
So kids say no to drugs
(That's right)

So you don't act like everyone else does
(Uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin' else to say
(Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no you haven't seen it, it's the size of a peanut
(Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world

If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back

Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull
His back starts tah look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'

And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting his money

Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

See children, drugs are bad
(That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad
(That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom
(You can)

She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
(She will)
So kids say no to drugs
(Smoke crack)

So you don't act like everyone else does
(That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say
(But umm)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?

And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off
Bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it

Yum, yum then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there
(Like what?)
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair

(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?)
It's yarn Claire, women stick 'em up their behinds
Go out and wear 'em
(Huh?)

And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?)
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung
(Gross)

See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at
(Oh)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

See children, drugs are bad
(Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad
(Put that down)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom
(You can ask)

She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
(And she will)
So kids say no to drugs
(Say no)

So you don't act like everyone else does
(Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say
(That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?

Come on children, clap along
(Shut up)
Sing along children
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad
(South Park is gonna sue me)

So don't do drugs children
So there'll be more for me
(Mushrooms killed Kenny)
(So, fucked up, right now)</p>

America
Ha ha ha
We love you

How many people are proud to be
Citizens of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights of men
Who have died for the protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech
The United States Government has sworn to uphold
  (Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song)
Or so we're told

I never would a dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many mothafuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
Its like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched
So much anger aimed at no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays straight through your radio waves
It plays and plays till it stays stuck in your head
For days and days
Who would a thought standin' in this mirror
Bleachin' my hair wit some peroxide
Reachin' for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the fore front of rap like this
How can I predict my words and have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office
Cuz Congress keeps tellin' me
I ain't causin' nottin' but problems
And now they sayin' Im in trouble wit the government
I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumpin' it on

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like ourself
If they were brown
Shady lose, shady sits on the shelf, but shady is cute
Shady knew shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby
(Ooo baby)
Look at myself,
Lets do the math if I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No lables wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like 'Fuck it'
Until I met Dre, the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got was probably his in exchange
For every white fan that he's got like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like 'My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?'

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
These moms probly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mothafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit me too 'cuz I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit a fine toothed comb
Its like this rope waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
'I dont like this, no'
All I hear is lyrics, lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely 'Hip Hop' is never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch
And say faggot shit
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The mothafuckin' spokesman now

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the damager aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it
With a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms Cheeney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freeness of speech
This divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Oooh)
Ha ha ha
I'm just playin' America, you know I love you</p>

Bustin lyrics in the air
Keepin some up in the chamber

Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin?

Skam:
Man, I'm releasin anger

Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin?

Shady: 
I'm releasin anger

(Verse 1)
Skam:
Man I'm tired of bein tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin, and endin up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin bitches, the buck stops here 
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone
You aint Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin to roll up on Miami, leavin with a broke neck
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up white rappers like im throwin gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber 
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?)

(Chorus)

Verse 2 
Eminem:
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your pukus, turnin to yellow with orange mukus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin 
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally
I'll take it back before we do each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started 
Cock block your fathers game 
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out
I'ma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know

Verse 1: Eminem
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula

Chorus: Thyme
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know

Verse 2: Eminem
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every dis you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess

Chorus: Thyme

No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles

And no ski's
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family
With groceries
Got a crib wit' a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques

Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?

Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, "Mother, fuck tha police"
Gave you tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood

And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggaz that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped

Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't gettin' no sleep
so fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucki' around wit' me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate
(What?)
Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
(Yup)
Then just study a tape of N.W.A.

One day I was walkin' by, wit' a Walkman on
When I caught a guy, give me an awkward eye
(What you lookin' at?)
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot
Wit' his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not

I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out wit' two broken legs, tryin' to walk it off
"Fuck you too bitch, call the cops"

I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit' a can full of gas and a hand full of matches

And still weren't found out
(Right here)
From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit' a Charleston Chew

Slim shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men, ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailie

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me
You muh'fuckers would stop comin' up to me
Wit' your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me

But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of
(Compton)

I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all?

'Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What 'cause I been in the lab wit' a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off?

I ain't havin' that, this is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap! You can have it back

So where's all the Madd Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped wit' gats
When you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish

{Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play}

Alright, stop!
(Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
(But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffe the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that! Do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
(You're right)
Not over this shit
(Stop!)
Drop the biscuit
(I will)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
You know what Dre I don't like your attitude

{Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play}

Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitches earlobe
Yo this girls only 15 years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
(Ah huh)

Fuck this bitch right on that spot there
Till she passes out she forgot how she got their
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie kids?
No, but I seen the porno that's on nubiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail

{Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man}

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit! You just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off
Wait! what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What'chu say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill ya motherfucker

Ah ha, temper, temper
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. A.K. comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aww fuck it what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?</p>

We're Still #1 Freestyle
Teats and Thurston Howell, and yelling Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerve purse with badly disturbed nerves
You wanna be the one to step up and get served first
99% of aliens prefer Earth
Come here to rule the planet, storm on your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
With smeared letters, runnin together and blurs spurts
Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts
I point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers
My first words were bleep bleep and curse curse
Never had shit and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third cert
Digging out my stitches, and hollering nurse nurse!
You said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse!

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants

I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls

I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators

My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me

I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire

(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron


I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)

I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats


Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets,ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's

Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums

I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it

I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys

If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin'  'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order

I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run

Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Suck my motherfuckin dick, D-12 dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid, swifty McVeigh, The Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady</p>

Remember me?
(I have no remorse)

Remember me?
(I'm 'High Powered')
Remember me?
  (I drop bombs like Hiroshima)

For this one it's the X, you retarded?
'Cause I grab the mic and get down, like Syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries
Which qualifies me for the term 'Universal'

Without no rehearsal, I leak words that's controvers'al
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch
That got "Banned From TV"

Heavyweight hitter
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco-is-the-motion, we comin' th'ough
Hollow tips is the lead the .45 threw

Remember me?

Remember me?
(Slam, slam)

Remember me?
(Nigga 'Bacdafucup')
Remember me?

Niggaz that take no for an answer, get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like, "No, no, no!"
Life a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead-a the cheddars and credda

Settle vendetta one metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence? Nope, never leave a shred-of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me

I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? You better dead that shit
My name should be "Can't believe that Nngga said dat shit"

Probably sayin', "He ain't a killer", but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'm-a do to you, have done to you
Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two

What you wanna do, cocksuckers? We glock-busters
'Til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires, niggaz wantin' me dead, wantin' my head
You think it could be somethin' I said?

Remember me?

Remember me?

Remember me?

When I go out, I'm-a go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to da club, stupid
I'm tryin' to clear up my fuckin' image, so I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say, "Fuckin'" for six minutes

Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts

In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats

Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
With M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?

Fuck that, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And re-appear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?

Don't you remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?</p>

The weak or the strong, who got it goin on
You're dead wrong

Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace.. smack the bitch in the face;
take her Gucci bag and the North Face 
off her back, jab her if she act
funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)

Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
but Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
with no hair in between, know what I mean?

And I never eat you unless the fuckin, meat looks fresh

He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall

Met on the second, wet on the third;

I'm a soldier

(Na na na nah na na nah)
I'm a soldier

Yo, never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta till I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see, if it's true, if it's you
What you say In your raps, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation will get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it
Bein' reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier

They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bring it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two, who needs bullets?
Soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out to the hot rocks parkin' lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not, 'cuz

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em

I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckas could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch
So ticky tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
Till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that adverse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a

I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim, but I wasn't
t tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs

Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody coulda seen this shitIfelt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell to catch me

The minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standin' and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt

Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold 2 million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, tryna get my feet on solid ground, so for now

Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€

Bury my face in comic books, 'cuz I don't wanna look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of tylonol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood

I prolly should 'cuz these problems are piled all at once
'Cuz everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl

Now I'm a responsible father so not alotta good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cuz I don't know how to do it
All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps

Of my dad 'cuz I hate him so bad
Worst feeling I had was growing up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em

Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€

  (Hollywood)
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
  (I feel this way)
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€

I don't wanna quit this shit, it feels like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick
Publicity my ass, consume my fuckin' dick

Fuck the guns, I'm done I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'ma scrap it like I never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had

I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that

It's like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact

Imagine going from bein' no one and seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up mceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€

  (Hollywood)
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
  (I feel this way)
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€, say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€

Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good
So, goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good</p>

All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill

All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill

Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan of citizen by stands
But shit is in my hands, here's your life span
For what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and live a nice land
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green, so bad I'm dehydratin'

Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'
I want the whole plot, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description an' sketches ya

The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cuz I got a daughter to feed
And dollar 200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
An' hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote

You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', "Freeze"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest

All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill

All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill

Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
Need a backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin' mouth before I blow the brain
From out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit

Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on "Set it off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove in through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Son, go in and call the police
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"

Tried to stall him atleast long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles

And colliding with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck

But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo
And I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin' "Truce, truce"
Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps

All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill

All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill

All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill

When to Stand Up
(scratched) (3X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -&gt; Mr. Garrison

Eminem]
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Moms wouldn't take it, the bitch still hates me
One day she said, "Go rake leaves," I said, "Make me!"
I'm proud to announce i was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta the fake school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
Break shit!

(scratched) (4X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"

Parl Yams]
Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit Parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in an air lock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven 
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than James Evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like Kool Keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease
Parl Yams be the chosen thug
What i spit be cold juice like a fruitful hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper life bushwick bill fucker leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'
And moms just told me to act, i've been wheelin'
So boy just slow your deck, i've been stealin'
I wet rappers cause it's me and Em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like Eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like (? ? ?) and bustin' your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggaz what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the Dutch

(scratched) (4X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"

Eminem]
I ended my last show with a horse swingin' a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two Zantacs I give a fuck if I sound whack
Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm Happy Gilmore, you slip me anything in pill form
I'm in to mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays 
and I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats I'ma keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So "I'm the Rapper, He's the DJ"
I'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin "F/U/C/K"
So Jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: "No!")
Y'all can kiss my ass until your lips stick to my pants

(scratched) (5X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"</p>

Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around
With my dear Veronica
Wait a minute, you hold hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other

Love, what do you know of love?
We were destined to be together I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No Roger that's not what I want to do
I love her, and we're going to be together
Never</p>

Till Hell Freezes Over
Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop)
To hip hop music (anthem)
Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music
until the day that I die (aight bitch)

Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ugji boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rocks
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like new tops
I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's
So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sending when hell freezes

chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced aint, it taste tainted
Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci-fi t.v
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Mommy


Intro: Frogg 

Whoah! 
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em 
and like, back and forth because ah 
this is.. what you thought it wasn't 
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen 
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background* 
And check out the man he goes by the name of er... 

Verse One: Eminem 

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady 
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady 
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer 
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer 
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from 
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album 
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open 
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then 
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall) 
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it 
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash 
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass 
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin 
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson 
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton 
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman 

Chorus: 

So when you see me on your block with two glocks 
Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac 
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!! 
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin 
tellin your boys that I'm on crack 
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!! 
So put my tape back on the rack 
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack 
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!! 
But see me on the street and duck 
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed 
Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!! 

Verse Two: Eminem 

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone 
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone 
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason 
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin 
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview 
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review 
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals 
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols 
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles 
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!) 
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion 
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion 
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic 
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict 
Half animal, half man 
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can 
With more holes than an Afghan 

Chorus 

Verse Three: Eminem 

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!) 
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine 
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin 
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion 
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure 
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher 
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches 
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes 
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush 
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush 
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed 
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team 
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian 
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again 
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median 
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in 

Chorus 

Outro: Eminem 

Hey, fuck that! 
Outsidaz.. 
Pace One.. 
Young Zee..</p>

Yo, I dedicate to this to yo

To all my fans, keeping y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
'Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditioning
Which I create, cause that's my mission
So, listen close to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay

I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, 'cause I get respect I pet you
(Boy)
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew
(C'mon)
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you

Pecker wood mad cause his record went wood
No, respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, "Heck, country western rap records are good"

So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both
(Ha, ha)
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere

It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's trying to hear some fuckin' old fart in a chair
Sittin' on stage, strummin' acoustic guitar in your ear
So, you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea

Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your fuckin' chest 'til your heart kicks in gear
(Bitch)
And fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew
Like I'ma say they names so they can be famous too

You just a quitter, and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of house of pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you
(I'ma kill you)

You just a quitter, and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you
(I'ma kill you)

Yo heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke
And I'ma tell these motherfucking fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you

You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you? Bitch, I had a show to do!
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin' mouth while you oh-for-two

Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfucking DJ and stole him too
So, you fall in a slump and get all emotional

So, now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap
Quicker but never last, and Everlast is a

Aight listen so this is what we ask of our fans
(Look)
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him

Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin'

Shit in five years we'll all be eating at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin' tables in that bitch
Cleaning the toilets
Aiyyo fuck this, cut this shit off

Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker!

Hit 'Em Up
Kill Whitey! Hahaha
Kill Whitey! Detroit! What? What?
Kill Whitey! Yo, yo
Kill Whitey! Haha! Look

First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight

Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em coming while you running out of breath
Steady ducking while I'm punching at your chest, you need to rest

Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's
Who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks

I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know!

Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up!

Hahaha, yo check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots!

Yo! Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's getting his ass floored for talkin back

Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch

Ha ha, now we got the whole industry making fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? There's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfucking Belle Isle Bridge

Unverified]

Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle everlast getting' killed with his chest open
Tryin' to throw a fuckin' punch, but you just chokin'
Havin' a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime

'Cause you suck motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin' 'bout you packing pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale

On his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whipping tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up Hip-Hop

Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up!

I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an Uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

What the fuck? Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin' guitar cord
And stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart

D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
'Cause we hit 'em up like motherfucking' Tupac Shakur
You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures

Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off

Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kicking a man while he's down goddamn, I quit
Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin' punk, aiyyo</p>

You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the windyou and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just let it gooo!}

My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin out
Your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch</p>

It's Ok
Eye-Kyu: Check it out, 
Eminem: Hey Kyu!

Eye-Kyu:
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Verse 1: Eminem
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried 
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q

Eye-Kyu:
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Verse 2: Eminem
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep 
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity 
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

Eye-Kyu:
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep</p>

Jealousy Woes II
Men singing:
Jealous! (8X)

Girls voice: (Talking over the singing)
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...

Verse 1:
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?

Chorus: Men Singing
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (8X)

Women's Voice: (Talking over singing)
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy

Verse 2:
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like 
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga** 
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...

Chorus: Men Singing
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (12X)</p>

Hey, listen
I love my job, it makes me feel like, Superman
Can you fly? I can
Wanna see?

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context

Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest

Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark

But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it

See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blond
'Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on

Constantly movin', constantly using
The constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams

I'll be here when y'all are gone re building
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy ? Probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then 'cause

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate

I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make, "Slim you're great"
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain

'Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it
But it's inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain

But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you</p>

Rap Superstar
(Eminem Speaking)
Most people don't see how much work is really involved 
in this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until i was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta 
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what i'm sayin
No matter what u just been through

(B-Real)
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large a big house 
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin up in the world 
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

(B-Real)
I remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
Lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears 
and losin some of your peers
And losin some of your self 
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will 
Till he crosses over still
Feelin no hate 
But fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rappin about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing 
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name

(Chorus)
So you wanna be a rap superstar 
And live large
A big house 
5 cars 
The rent charged
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house 
5 cars 
The rent charged
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

(Noreaga Speaking)
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
Cuz the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep 
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And mafuckin get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And the drug game is even worse
Because if someone jerks you 
You can shoot em and kill me
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

(Eminem Speaking)
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what i'm sayin give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

(Chorus)

(B-Real)
My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonley
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by sony
I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar 
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy 
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil

(Chorus)</p>

Wasting My Time
by Bookmat

I don't think you understand
That what you're doing is not so cool
You think it's funny to mess with my mind
Don't you

You know I like you so you just tease me
You give me just enough to hang on enough
When you're just wasting my time
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time

Do you hear me when I say
So let me ask you something
Do you think I'm pretty or don't you
Do you wanna get with me or not and nowwww

Or are you just wasting my time
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time
And what would you've got to say
Well things have got to change
Say this just isn't right
I don't wanna have to fight
And I think I'd better go
Cause this ain't working out any more
and I'm sorry, sorry, sorry

Understand
That what you did
Was just not so cool
Baby, you're just not that cool</p>

Intro (Slim Shady)


May I have your attention please 
May I have your attention please 
Will the Real Slim Shady please stand up? 
I repeat, will the Real Slim Shady please stand up? 
We're gonna have a problem here... 
{verse 1} 
Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before 
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door 
Started whoopin her ass worst than before 
they first were dirvorced sold her old furniture (scream) 
It's the return of the 
"Awww wait, no way, your kidding 
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?" 
And Dr Dre said... 
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead he's locked in my basement (haha) 
Feminist women loved Eminem 
Chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him 
Look at him walking around grabing his you-know-what 
Flippin' the you-know-who (yea but hes so cute though) 
Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose 
But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms 
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and let Loose, 
but can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose 
"My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips 
And if im lucky u might just give it a little kiss" 
And that's the messege we deliver to little kids 
and expect them not to know what a women's *vagina* is 
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is 
by the time they hit 4th grade, 
they got the discovery channel don't they? 
We ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us cannibals 
who *rip* other people open like canolopes 
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes 
then theres no reason that a man and another man can't elope (ughh) 
But if you feel like I feel I got the antadoite 
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus 
And it gooooesss 
(Refrain) 
I'm Slim Shady 
Yes I'm the Real Shady 
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady... 
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up 
Cause I'm Slim Shady 
Yes I'm the Real Shady 
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So won't the real Slim Shady... 
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up 
{verse 2} 
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records 
Well I do, so *f---* him and *f---* you too 
You think I give a damn about a grammy? 
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me 
(but Slim what if u win wouldn't it be weird?) 
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here? 
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears 
s--- Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs 
So I can sit next to Carson Daily and Fred Durst 
And hear them argue over who she gave *head* to first 
Little *bitch* put me on blast on MTV 
(yea hes cute but I think he's married to Kim, hehe) 
I should download a audio on mp3 
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem *head* (scream) 
I'm sick of you little golden boy groups all you do is annoy me 
So I been sent in here to destroy you 
And there's a million of us just like me 
Who cuss like me 
Who just don't give a *f---* like me 
Who dress like me 
Walk, Talk and act like me 
It just might be the next best thing 
But not quite me 
(Refrain) 
{verse 3} 
I'm like a headtrip to listen to 
Cause I'm only giving you 
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room 
The only difference is I got the balls to say it In front of ya'll 
And I don't got to be false or sugar coat it at all 
I just get on the mic and spit it 
Wheather you like to admit it 
I'm better than 90% of you rappers out there 
Then you wanna outkin kids like these albums like 
Its funny cuz the rate im going when I'm 30 
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting 
Pinching nurses asses when I'm *hard* jerkin I'm jerking 
But this whole bag of viagra isn't working 
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin 
He could be workin at Burger King spitten on your onion rings 
Were in the parking lot circling 
screaming I don't give a *f---* 
With his windows down and system up 
So will the Real Shady, please stand up 
and put one of those fingers on each hand up 
and to be proud to out of your mind and out of control 
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? 


Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up</p>

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm

Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks

I make you think you're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think
You're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Stay away from him, he ain't no good

We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors

Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

I make you think you're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think
You're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Stay away from him, he ain't no good

I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass

To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya

I make you think you're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think
You're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Stay away from him, he ain't no good

I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place, went

I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

I make you think you're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think
You're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Stay away from him, he ain't no good

Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine

He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

I make you think you're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think
You're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Stay away from him, he ain't no good

I make you think you're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think
You're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Stay away from him, he ain't no good

I make you think you're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think
You're a best friend then, why I oughtta
Stay away from him, he ain't no good</p>

Places To Go
by 50 Cent

(50 Cent saying)

yeah

Shady (echo)
aftermath (echo)
see you met you (Echo)

CHORUS

I got places to go, I got people to see,
The penitentiary, ain't the place for me,
I'm warnin you do, not tempt me,
I'll run up and squeeze
And put a hole in you, hole in you

(Repeat)

Verse 1
you mistaken me for somebody that you should be testing,
your should be stressin I'm gonna fuckin teach you a lesson,
MAC 101's in session and lace the track that I'm blessin,
smith and western's, the weapon, in case you just guessing, (God Damh (Echo))
these straight busters kept-in, kept-in my benz, hop-in the end's,
watch the 22 spin , my hoe's a perfect 10
I got shot up but I got up and i'm back at it again,
motherfuckers they thought I would'nt win, pretend to be friends,
at first you fail, try, try, try, try again,
i'm the best don't you get it, forget it, when I spit it, its crazy,
you love it, admit it, you like it, I live it, its shady,
aftermath in your ass bitch, if its not a classic,
When it's dumped, trash it, so I got it mastered,
stop and get your ass kicked, bastered, your misses get drastic,
glock made out of plastic, cock-it and get blasted, run nigga and stash it...

CHORUS

Verse 2
There is a genie in that bottle of that don-pari'on,
I'm a drink till I get to that bitch in the morn,
Introduce me to the booth they gonna listen to my words,
In the hood they feel my shit...
(break-it down...)

Picture a perfect picture, picture me in the paper
Picture me starting shit, picture me busting my gat,
picture police man Dan gotta picture of that,
picture me being broke, picture me smokin a sack,
picture me comin up, picture me rich from rap,
picture me blowin up, now picture me going back,
to my momma basement to live, shit, picture that,
where I'm from its a fact, you gotta watch your back,
you wear a vest without a deck, use a target jack,
hastle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack,
sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, crew are back,
50 Cent, too much spent?, man I'm bent, I'm out'ta here

CHORUS

(50 Cent Saying)
Ha ha
Man I aint going to jail
Not even to visit a nigga
You want to holla at me you wright me,
Matter a fact, you gotta send it to Sunset Boulevard,
In Montreal,
Ha ha

or matter a fact I might be in Detroit,
riding down 8 Mile road,

Ha ha

Ha ha ha ha ha,

Yo, Slim Shady
Yo, Royce 5 9
Y'all wanna make a movie?
What
We got the film right here

What? Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really hafta, I really slap ya
King of Detroit who they namin' the city after
(What?)
Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit

Into your heart with, content, yo who wanna start with
Experts, Bad and Evil is comin' soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
(What?)

Leavin' all of you cats shittin' kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggaz be cockin' pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin' the profits with you
(What?)
Six percent, of y'all niggaz is just pretend

Clicks with clits, pussy niggaz stink with dicks
(What?)
Niggaz act bully, and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggaz packin' semi
Speak darts, yo you get paid? Rhymin' about it is the sweet part

You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
Five Nine, a street nigga with deep feelin'
(What?)
I keep illin', my steez willin' to keep killin'
(What?)
Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts

Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
(What?)

Niggaz is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders
What?  Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'ma pit bull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
(What?)
Split y'all, holla, "It's on", then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggaz get pissed on claimin' you pissed off

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'

I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
(Here)
'Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin' takin' advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
(Leave me alone!)

Came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
Screamin' to Aunt Peg
(Aunt Peg)
With three spokes stickin' out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine

Dammit I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps

Then I'm throwin' you back up 'em
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em
The rap struck 'em harder then gettin' hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on

And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
(Ding ding!)
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
(Hurry up man)
I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie

I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
And still have half left

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

Bad, the bad
Uhh, when the bad meets the bad, yo
The evil
Take the evil with the evil
Put 'em together
What?  Nine-nine
Two times, Slim Shady, Royce the Five Nine</p>

(I'm not afraid)...Yeah...(I'm not afraid)
(To take a stand)...It's been a ride...(To take a stand)
(Everybody)...I guess I had to...(Everybody)
(Come take my hand)...Go to the that place-...(Come take my hand)
(Come take my hand)...-to get this one...(Come take my hand)
(We'll walk this road together)...Now some of you...(Through the storm)

(Whatever weather)...Might still be in that place...(Cold or warm)
(Just let you know)...You're trying to get out...(You're not alone)
Just Follow me...(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)...I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em

Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)

Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW (POW)
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons

These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road (same road)
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage... age
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons

I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now... nowww)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club

Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road (same road)</p>

When I just a little baby boy,
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
she used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
and I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin I could do or say to try to change it
cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein broke no more
They say I can't rap about coke no more
(AHHH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
(AHHH!) These motherfuckers are thinkin I'm playin
Thinkin I'm sayin the shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin it
(AHHH!) Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you
(AHHH!) Shut up slut, you're causin too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You god damn right BITCH, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, VRINNN! {*chainsaw revs up*}
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
danglin from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls leave - you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me - I'm bringin the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin but a girl to me
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you.

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ask to rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? NO! Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
to do it again, THEN, if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the 10th
(Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls leave - you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me - I'm bringin the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin but a girl to me
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you.

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause lady's screams keep creepin in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
this eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!
TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
from fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
from principal to the study body and counselor
from in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin I'm leavin air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it
OKAY, I'M READY TO GO PLAY
I GOT THE MACHETE FROM O.J.
I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROATS ACHE
You faggots keep eggin me on
til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
SHUT UP! Give me your hands and feet
I said SHUT UP when I'm talkin to you
YOU HEAR ME? ANSWER ME!

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls leave - you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin I don't squash the beef

just let em come to you
cause they gon always say and do
what the other one do
so let em come to you
the rest 'll just follow suit

doesnt take much
for me to race up and stank up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you dont even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
like smearin bloodstains with a paint brush
i cant explain what it is my brain does
but however it works its insane just plain nuts
and it aint just my brain thats dangerous
its a whole combination of things
it takes nuts
and im not afraid to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
for anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
im paitently waitin for the day
im anxious
to see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
you're drunk you aint tough
whatever you drank musta just turned you into some gangstas
this is me talkin motherfucker this aint drugs
you wanna pop shit
wake up
then make up
fuck that
it's to late chump now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calibur that nas and jay does
opens up his jaws to say somethin to rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
till i peel the pain off
i never been shot but i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
cause i've always came off like Ja's chain
when they tried to rush him and lost
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
i dont stop
only thing that i wait for is the day that i dont gotta report to probate court
cause ima give you all the reason to hate more
cause i've been holdin my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
alot of rappers on my list
it just aint ja
and ima read the motherfucker off come april
you pussies think i went soft cause 8 mile
when i come back
ill be shootin more than just paint balls

monkey see monkey do
they'll never make the first move
just let em come to you
cause they gon always say and do
what the other one do
so let em come to you
the rest 'll just follow suit
monkey see monkey do
tweedle dee tweedle dum
if they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come

we talkin to every-motherfuckin-body who wants to bring it
cause we bringin it to anybody who wants to bring it
so bring it
dont pick up the ball if you dont wanna play man
it's all fucked up now
what the fuck am i s'posed to do now?
huh?
what the fuck am i s'posed to do?
haha
yo we out</p>
]

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'mma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Until the roof
(Until the roof)
The roof comes off
(The roof comes off)
Until my legs
(Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me

I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me</p>
]

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but them never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet - One more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet - Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, I'ma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet - One more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yer lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that yer phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself, that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get,
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet - One more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet</p>

Your 'bout to witness hip hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is back!
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadams got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
VRRM VRRM Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
away from you, dear fear none
Hip hop is in a state of nine-one-one, so.

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness? (Dr Dre)] (Hell Yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness? (Dr Dre)] (Hell Yeah!)

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to your lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exagerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks, who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and André's carnival, c'mon, now!

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness? (Dr Dre)] (Hell Yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness? (Dr Dre)] (Hell Yeah!)

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, played career russian roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around round here
Yo Dre! (what up?) Can I get a hell? (Hell Yeah!)

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness? (Dr Dre)] (Hell Yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness? (Dr Dre)] (Hell Yeah!)

So there you have it folks

Marshall!

Has come to save the day
Back with his friend André
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because

Marshall!

And André are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and grey

Marshall!

So until next time friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening

Marshall!

Oh, hah</p>

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'mma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse

Until the roof
(Until the roof)
The roof comes off
(The roof comes off)
Until my legs
(Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me

I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me</p>

Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo

Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demostrated against
Picket signs for my wickid rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind, of the mother fucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning, and taking names in the evening
Leave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha prolly sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now


I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
One More Time

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailey, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grin my teeth and I try to make it work
With her atleast for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'd of killed em, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
One More Time

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
Ha!

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse when shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of munchhausen syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, your getting older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she wont even be at your funeral *hahaha*
See what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mum
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
One More Time

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
Ha!</p>

A lot of people ask me. stupid fuckin questions
A lot of people think that. what I say on records
or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that.
I'm actually gonna do it
or that I believe in it
Well, shit. if you believe that
then I'll kill you
You know why?

Cuz I'm a CRIMINAL
CRIMINAL
You goddamn right-- I'm a CRIMINAL
Yeah, I'm a CRIMINAL

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress - hate fags? The answer's "yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin at my jeans, watchin my genitals bulgin (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin balls, you'd better let go of em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of em
Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin the mail
Get it? Checkin the 'male'? (clicks tongue twice)
How many records you expectin to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon!-- Relax Guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen (AAA-men!)
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin each March
With a brand new cd for these fuckin retards
Duhhh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. "Don't Give A Fuck," still won't leave

I'm a CRIMINAL
Cuz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
to tell em what's on my mind - I guess I'm a CRIMINAL
but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird
and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs - hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out - disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a CRIMINAL - an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word...
My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happenin to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em
-inem and Kim combined - *kch* the maniac's in
Replacin the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin his place
(Mm-mm-mmm!) Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thing put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a CRIMINAL

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
get the motherfuckin money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waitin on you
Aight
Yo Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright... god damn, fuck...
how you doin'?
HI, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawl
Okay
Put the fuckin money in the bag bitch
and I won't kill you!
 What? Oh my god, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin around...
Don't kill me, I have two kids at home, don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fuckin kill you
Hurry the fuck up! {*BOOM*} Thank you!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Then fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets!
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a CRIMINAL
Cuz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
to tell em what's on my mind - I guess I'm a CRIMINAL
but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird
and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
What the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window holdin' a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car they shot in
Lookin' for 's killers, dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than
Pissed off, 'cause and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin' shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman ("Goddammit")
I'm anti- and
The instinct to kill, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and 's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
sucked a lot of dick
Boy and girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (ha, ha, ha)
don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe] to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (he-he)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' "I don't care, just bite me" (nah, nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo root beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer

Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away
I'm not a wrestler, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (ahh)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck (blaow)
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help
From to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""? you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck
Now because of this blond mop that's on top
And this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop? (pop)
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with,
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90-some cousins (Hey it's me)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey)
And then to top it off, I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uhh, here - double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants

I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls

I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators

My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me

I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire

(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron

I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)

I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats

Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets, ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's

Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums

I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it

I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys

If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order

I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run

Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Suck my motherfuckin dick, D-12 dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid, swifty McVeigh, The Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady</p>

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world

So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot
Think I've got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot

Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop

Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I’ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool

The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, took a see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice

How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife she ever saw in her life

I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a 'Fuck you' letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady

Yo, I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit

But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we're on the subject
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it

I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms
Do drink beer, I just wanna make a few things clear

My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitchin'
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for bein' AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady

I told you I was Shady, yo, y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady and that's my name</p>
]

May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're going to have a problem here
Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin her ass worse than before
They first get divorced throwing her over furniture (scream)
It's the return of the
Oh wait, no way, your kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (haha)
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flipin' the you know who yeah, but hes so cute though
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose,
But can't, but its cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
By bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a womens clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit 4th grade
They got the discovery channel don't they
We ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote
Women wave your panty hoes, sing the and it goes

I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
because I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damm about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim what if u win wouldn't it be weird
Why So you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, hehe
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D. (scream)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And theres a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me
Who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing
But not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
Because I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up

I'm like a headtrip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of ya'll
And I don't gotta be frost or sugar coated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90% of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kidz eat up these albums like valiums
Its funny cuz at the rate im going when I'm 30
Ill be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens and I'm jerking
But this whole bag of viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be workin at Burger King spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling
Screaming I don't give a fuck
With his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go

'Cause I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim shady
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
Haha I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us

STAN - 16/12/2000
1 week at #1 - 17 Weeks on chart

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways fuck it, what's been up Man how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
Four hours and you just said, No
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S
We should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
C'mon - how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was. it was you
Damn

WITHOUT ME - 01/06/2002
1 week at #1 - 16 Weeks on chart

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Ooooohhhhh

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady
I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the Doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating Hey
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Miss Cheney
But your husbands heart problem's complicated
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prison is helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing Attention Please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me

la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la
la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la
"Kids!"

LOSE YOURSELF - 14/12/2002
1 Week at #1 - 21 Weeks on chart

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up over, blah
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You'd better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you'd better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You'd better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you'd better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

The soul's escapin', thru this hole that it's gapin'
This world is mine for the takin'
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin'', but superstardoms close to post mortal
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
His homes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old potna, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da la la

You'd better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you'd better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You'd better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you'd better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonour caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got

You'd better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you'd better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You'd better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you'd better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You'd better

You can do anythin' you set your mind to, man

LIKE TOY SOLDIERS - 12/02/2005
1 Week at #1

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart
We never win
But the battle rages on for toy soldiers
I'm suppose to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line, you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
Now it's never my object to for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And that's just outta respect for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my live, like fuck it
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart We never win
But the battle rages on for toy soldiers

It used to be time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja start gabbing in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulley'd in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motha fucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
Still have soldiers that is on the front line that's willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in
our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of me people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
Now don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm copping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quiet popping off at the jaws with the knocking
Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscious

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart We never win
But the battle rages on for toy soldiers

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're

No time to waste. Back to my place

Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because

Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Yeah,

Oh baby, baby how was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now

That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time</p>

Eminem:

i'll shove a gun in your grill
grease it and heat it
smother it in hot mustard
so when i feed it to you
it's easy to eat it
you need to be immediately
freezen
while you breathen
and you'll be leavin
in the recieven room
in the seat of a jesus
you hate on this
we'll be waiting on eight corners
swarming your hood with
a thousand angry skateboarders
i'll hop in a jeep
and slam down on the gas
and charge you
and bombarde you
in the car that your mom bought you
fucked around and get choked
and found remote
floatin around
down face down
in a boat
i'll pile five dudes
and a tentor will pull up
to a seven mile drive through
in mcdonalds and pile drive you
i've got the power
to snap the driver
out of his
zeddy bower
while he drives by it ninety miles an hour
this place is my house
i might as well erase my face with white out
cause y'all can't see me like mace's eyebrows
(where you at?)
climbed out of a nice house through the front window and heard this guy shout
(Hey! thats my couch)
pulled a nine out during a rhinebout while i'm rippin the shit with a clip
and i spit 5 rounds and murder you ho's worse than a convertable flippin vertical nose
first with the top off landing upside down.
Or get tied down with duct ape,
fuck rape i'd rather just hump a sluts legs with my nuts shaved</p>

Spoken]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not, always make sense to you right now.
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip.
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry, everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why, we fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby, but I promise momma's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block, and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And momma didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it

I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house,
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
Imma give you the world
Imma buy a diamond ring for you, imma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
Imma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)</p>

Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Sike!

If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter

Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battling
But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake

There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smoking crack?

Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground, 'for I put some wack shit out
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark

Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out, fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle

Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap
You're slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,

This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops

There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,

Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor

I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical

I'll allergic to dying, you think not? you got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops

I was happy having a deal at first,
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg

When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling

When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till you car spin you then

Damn!
U slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm

About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops

Let's see how many of your men loyal,
When I pull up looking for you,
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode

With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man

Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic

I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night

When The Music Stops

Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors

You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach, the more I moves
This hill street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop

Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
NWA said fuck the police
Now I'm in jail
93 was strictly R&amp;B
Fucked up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike
Ass cheeks painted white
Fucking Presilla at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
MOP had me grindy and griddy
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bowls
Now I'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops</p>

Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that.

I heard a noise, where you goin'? What are you, bananas?!
You can't go back there, stupid ass!

A beastiality porno with smoothies.

It's Eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
The "Beauty And The Beast", his back is hairy.
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very.
No, Zack! Don't go back in there!

He screams: "Bloody Mary!" - Grabs a mirror
But stop just ain't in her vocabular.
"Get off me, please! Get off me, stop!"
Ballin' back at a coffee shop.
They go non-stop. - She says: "Go!"
He says: "No! " - She says: "Oh!"
Back and forth, they scream and shout.
Yeah, boy; let them demons out!
It's the kinda nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh! Now the whipped cream is out.

I'm a little nutty and I know it
but if you go back and
take a look at my history
you will see that I'm
not the only one who's off his rocker
there were many before me
I was always labelled
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed I
grow to be but if you take a look
at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

(haha) alright, look
I'ma tell you the story
from my side maybe you'll understand check it out
you done witnessed
unexplainable shit
too insane to explain
people run from what
the just don't get
maybe Shady shoulda
just hit 'em with a little bit
did I spit too soon?
Should I of spoon fed 'em it?
but I was just so eager
to prove I was even worth
being in the same
league or the room with of the people
of whom I was in every now and then I
look up like I was seeking approval
was it because of the
pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of
my imagination
maybe it bothered me
more than it did them
maybe it wasn't a big
deal back then
but to me it was, see
what it was was
I had developed the
complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse,
now I'm next, let's see who
I'm in the booth
staring back to see who's mugs
I get a reaction from,
usually the first thumb was from
Proof
and the rest of the
group backed him up
and no one lied to
each other cause none of us had deals
it was real, we just

wanted tickets for that meal

Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my

family

cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

Ever since my mother
was pregnant
with her second egg
cause she said
that I had a baby sister
who fell out of the window
I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects
I was like 5, 6, and how come
I remember Malcolm,
Isaac, and Boogie
if it was the projects in Missouri?
cause those're my best
friends until Isaac
took my tricycle and
my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up getting
jumped and cut in the gut with a
switch and 70-some stitches
which is still, to this day
why my mother still
tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious little
sister who never existed and this is why part of

my life's so twisted
but I can never be as

sick as that bitch is
and, by the way, that
picture's one of my relatives

Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like

it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy

but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

You probably have to
peel back layers upon layers of
pain to see why everything
I say is so insane
what's different about my brain that separates me
from other players in this game? on the surface, it may
seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
for me to get some damn sympathy
but that's the last thing
I need is for people
to walk around feeling
sorry for me (me)

and I'm not a G, never
claimed to be
I gave my vest to
Cashis,

he'll need it more than me
but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
but if it comes our
way, what do we, turn the other
cheek? come on

Sometimes I feel like
it's just me
sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy
but take a look at my family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
it's just me

I'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family

fall too far from the tree</p>

If I woulda rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say something about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your
Pants, cause I'm white, and he's white, so he's like
My competition I mean, right?
Nope, Paul Wall is dope
And so's Bubba, so BLALALALAPFFTTTTT
B-b-b-b-b-but, I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali
Shuffle, and dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometime's I just play possom, Like I'm asleep that's awesome
I'm like a sleeping Giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite Prey
Sink my teeth in him and fill him, full of poison
And make a noise like snake before I kill him
And let him know that I just don't feel him
And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why, look them dead in the eye, then waste em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
And the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Their souls, for this rap game, and it g-g-goes
123, 123, 123, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

"Shady, I know you're in there, so where? Come here
Talk to me, sit here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? Hahahahaha
Dye it back, come on, try it" AHHHHHHHHH
No, I told you, leave me the fuck alone will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you", But I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for eachother
Think about your mother", yeah so what of her?
"Well think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes...", fuck you motherfucker!
I had you beat "No I was playin' possom, remember?
I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your souls mine
I'm taking it back", you fucking bitch WHY!
"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? haha"

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

"Shady, listen... "SHADY!", you hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"
But I don't want it back! "Yes you do..."
No I don't! "Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!"
No I won't! "I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday
"Well I got him on the phone right now!"
You're lying, "yo slim", HOW, WHY NOW!
Whatup Dre? "Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya
I don't know, it just seems every since you got off ya
Drugs, you became a lot softer"
But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
"Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back, and let me know what's up"
Fuck this mirror! AHHHHHHH
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you"
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch
"Put the gun down", BYE BYE!
Ok I'm still alive, "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to
Haha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you, prayed to god
You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right through
Look at this house, look at these cars, I'm so nice, wooo!
Oh, but you didn't know, fame has a price too
That you're just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill
Become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall..." WHAT! "no one's gonna love you like I do!"

My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I said, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body</p>

Guess Who

Did you Miss me?

Jessica Simpson sing the

Dina Rea – (Eminem)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You’re a … rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player… Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

(VERSE ONE)
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man… no don’t massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can, can, don’t ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Samantha’s a 2, You’re practically a 10
I know you want me girl,
In fact I see your grin
(Now come in girl)

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)

Player… Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

(VERSE TWO)
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Sorry Portia, but what’s Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my ventolin inhaler and 2 Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Brit f’rget K-Fed let’s cut off the middle man
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won’t be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little atten-tion
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in-
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give ‘em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You’re a … rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player… Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

(VERSE THREE)
And that’s why… my love
You'll never live without,
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don’t try to deny it baby, I’m the only one for you

Damn girl I’m beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that’s bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don’t mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth(brrp)
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he’s about to flip
Jessica rest assure, Superman’s here to rescue ya
Can you blame me?
You’re my Amy, I’m your Blake
Matter fact make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
(Now break it down girl)

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You’re a … rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player… Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

So baby, baby

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down

"G.O.A.T."

I'm a goat
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

This is the part I was worried about
everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
and I'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
and everyone's telling me what I should do
and how I should come out and what to rap about
and I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
and I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
they're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky (haha)
like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
see, the thing about me
is you don't really know a thing about me
everyone's making a stink about me
like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers
and the most dangerous criminals
and I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
but, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
but why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees?
so when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-z
please, be that just subliminally
means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's
the only one up in that league, see
and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
knowing god damn well that I'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period.

I'm a goat
and I don't mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen
man, I thought I was crazy
or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Wall's white
cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
and Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
because he's so caught up in that snow white
that Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
he's so gone off that coke, right
and it's so sad, cause he's dope, right
America's next great white hope, right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right
and which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
they said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
and I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"
and I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that
but these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
but I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
when suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me must've died
thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
and anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
and Angelina Jolie is just another ho
and Brad is a sucka' because once I fuck her
she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
you know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you want a Shady? Well, you got it, man
I ain't apologizin' for shit.

I'm a goat
and I don't mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
shit is too easy
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
(I'm a goat)
so don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
but y'all know that
(I'm a goat)
and like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
but before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start
and thank you very much to everybody who was
and y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know
(I'm a goat)

I'm out, y'all
it's been real, peace</p>

Candy-painted tint, it's(?) so dark
I'd be lying if I said I ain't hit

Plus, I got so much candy paint in my rims
Paint be flyin' off my car
Be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, there go the candy man
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin'
The rims are still spinnin'
Hit the wheels on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
32-inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat?
Custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, "Ah, there go them superstars!"
Hit every single store, flash a fucking wad of cash

Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up
And I'ma hit the cinema and I'ma get the hoes,

These bitches don't get a crumb, and it come

Aight, here's where I come in at...

I came in this game with, bad intentions,
and I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin,
so you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
step right in this mark with my henchmen and
walk, straight to the stage,
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
fall back, little cocksucker, I ain't A&amp;W
don't get your cold mugs in my way
get 'em? Shattered, fuckin' A
been this way since B.C., what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
don't get turned to a vegetable dick face
you ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D-12 spittin' flames like flamethrowers
spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors
that cut with the same force as chainsaws
hope you're coming with your A game,
'cause things have changed in this game, isn't the same game, boys
the stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
when they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us</p>

My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's liver when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball and I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You probably got stripped, you wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley come on I'm hard, guard me
Ain't booin', ain't pursuin', no lawsuits, I ain't suin'
I know what I'm doin', give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed, I remind me the spirit of Proof
I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
LeBron sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down

(Detroit basketball)
Homie like I told you this is(Detroit basketball)
Man I don't think you ready for the

I get the crowd rolled up Like a U-Haul truck
Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and I'm...
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints

Now homie this is(Detroit basketball)
Homie like I told you this is(Detroit basketball)
Man I don't think you ready for the
We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
I said we get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
Yeah
Ahh
I said ahh
Give me the ball
You gotta walk before you crawl
Tell me you ain't listenin
This is Detroit basketball Homie, hey yo
Beam me up Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa</p>

CHORUS
Songs for the bump, songs for the street
Niggas know the kinda tone when I'm on the beat
'cause if the rumbababum all in ya Jeep
These people know what I do with the empty seat

Bizarre]
Hip Hop hip that's the way of life
Ya think ya nice? Then go grab the mic
Let me tell you my story, 'cause everybody got one
Grabbed a pen and pad and startin' to jot somethin'
Always told myself, that I would never be losin'
Man I ain't had no hood, my mother was always movin' (damn!)
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room, and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older metaphors got stronger
And me my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is Hip Hop, Hip man I won't stop
Yo Big Boi (what up?), gimme a beat box

Hip Hop Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop
Hip Hop

Chorus

Bizarre]
From the Hip Hop Shop to Maurice Malone
10 years later, I'm still in the zone
7 Mile off Runyon where a star was born
United we stand, divided we swore
And hell yeah, I lived in my car
Bitch I was homeless I would have slept in a jar
And Dirty Management, I wish y'all the best
But me and my niggas we had to do what's best
To lose the mess
All the taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce we couldn't buy a ounce
And now that we platinum, they diss our name
Like we won't go to the car and get them thangs
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
To the fight with Whitey Ford to the beef with Royce
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos and the niggas in the club
To the E-Dubs and niggas that you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun
But I'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come

Eminem]
Man I thought this was supposed to be hip hop hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock did, I
can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar riff
That Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger
When I was younger I was so eager to have a gun
I would do the same, I couldn't wait to get to the shooting range
Me and my man goofy Gary would just try to let off some steaaaammmmm
Motherfuckers laughin' 'cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thang
I used to have this theory, keep 3 bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no CCW license
I tried to apply for one, they said it'd take 5-6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now, back to what my 3 bullet theory was
I'm triple platinum I ain't tryna catch no murder one
Figured I'd shoot to wound probably miss with at least one
But them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his knee cap up
Them I'ma say self defense how come I had the gun
Was because I was at the range on the way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I get a year from each bullet at the most as opposed to havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic it was basically for safety
But it gave me power and it made me crazy
And psychotic I just got retarded, once I got up and gotta
It was empty the night I got caught with it
What the fuck man I thought this was supposed to be...

Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted. In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (yo)
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (yo)
(You better)

The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da da da

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna
Baby mama drama's screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot.
Feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You can do anything you set your mind to, man</p>

Just Blaze - Chorus]
Some people ask me, where I? ve been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
I play in the background, I don? t back down
So don? t get it twisted, tryna play me
First I come out, they underate me
Then I come back, still try to fade me
They say I? m nasty, say I? m crazy
Ask what I think, I say maybe
I fly away
It ain? t nothin? in my way so I may aswell fly away
It ain? t nothin? else to say so I may aswell fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today
Cos I? ve been to the top and there? s nowhere else to go
The only way to see me is if you lookin? up from down below
And there? s nothin? else to say so I may aswell fly away
And there? s nothin? in my way so I may aswell fly away
I? m on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away

Eminem - Verse 1]
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I? ma step up on the stage now, I? m gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt
And you aint gotta tell me notin? boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don? t stink, I dont think so
Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll
Are you ready now, here we go
The bald eagle has landed
I? m back in ya hair, sorry for leavin? you stranded
Im twice as dread and evil and rancid
They cant sit, I don? t think anybody understands it
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough
I aint got to play though, they say I died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it? d be a trailer not a car
The white trash star
I f-ckin RV up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, your dippin your soup inside ya crackers
I can carry rap til my back hurts
Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors
Get my back right
Now I? m right back on you bastards
I was chasin? the dragon, I dont know what happened
It was like the feelin? I had when I first started rappin?
I just could? nt seem to get back and recapture that magic

So I went back to the lab, thats where I? ve been at when?

Got the f-cking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles

My pubes hotter than you
Your soft I use fire to cool me off
I told em I? ll grow up one day and show ? em I? d be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightenin? bolts and throw ? em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgie porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for em
Make ? em swarm, make ? em fight over the shirts I? ve worn
Sworn over my sweat towels, its mind blowin
Yes Im livin? the dream homie, cant nothin? compare
I? m so up, I? m stuck in mid air I? m lovin? it yeah
Its like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters is so p-ssy they? re afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe ? em back pay
They spat in my face, now I? m back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste,
And slap it back out, before I step back out of this crap thanks
Slap me now I? m slapping ? em back hey! f-ck it we? ll slap back
But yeh okay now we? ll talk cause I? m smack ay
And I aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack
How? s that for hindsight, what the track say?

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase

Never know what kind of car I'll be in

You don't want that

I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do

Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play

Alright, stop! Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You'd better think of the consequence
"But who are you?"
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it, before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns

Fuck that, do that shit
Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit?
Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?
Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
Not over this shit
Stop!
Drop the biscuit
Don't even listen to Slim, yo
He's bad for you

You know what, Dre?
I don't like your attitude

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now listen to me: while you're kissin' her cheek
Smearin' her lipstick, I slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...

Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair

Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Till she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kids"?
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine years old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man

Alright, calm down
Relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat!
Cut this bitch's head off!
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright, Shady
Maybe he's right, Grady but think about the baby, before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it
Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did
Be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?
What'd you say?
What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker!
Ah-ah, temper, temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A? Mr. AK, coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?</p>

Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it, before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns

Funk that, do that s__t
Hit that lid
Can you afford to blow this hit?
Are you that rich?
Why you care if you scare her to death?
Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives a f__k if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
Not over this shit
Stop!
Drop the biscuit
Don't even listen to Slim, yo
He's bad for you

You know what, Dre?
I don't like your attitude

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now listen to me: while you're kissin' her cheek
Smearin' her lipstick, I slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chick's earlobe...

Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, she's passed out

It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
And pick this chicken up
Get her off Brad's couch and leave her in front of the porch of mom and dad's house
Till she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kids"?
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, funk that, drop her off, ring the doorbell then bail

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine years old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man

Alright, calm down
Relax, start breathin'
Star breathin', man?
You just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?
Forget gettin' divorce
Cut this chicken head off!
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his ____?
Alright, Shady
Maybe he's right, Grady but think about the baby, before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it
Still wanna grab her?
Kick her out the house, get this daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did
Be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?
What'd you say?
What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, you lil' motherf____r!
Ah-ah, temper, temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A? Mr. AK, coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way?
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, f___k it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?</p>
]

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.

Women wave your pantyhose, sing the and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,

Please stand up,
Please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me

Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,

Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,

Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,

Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Fuck it,
Let's all stand up!</p>

Eye-Kyu: Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Eminem: Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

1: Eye-Kyu
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus, my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

2: Eminem
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A, B, C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

Eye-Kyu
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

My name is micky i am a dreamer for thoes ones who love me
I like to wright wright thoes love songs ya i
wake up in the land of glory with my saints i
will tell my story there will be no sham
becausewake up in the land of glory with my
saints i will tell my story there will be a paraid
with glory telling my story how i am micky and this is my story</p>
]

Oh no what's happening to my brain
I can't believe this is happening again

Lava out my lips I flips
Wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man
I think I need another mask
I'd ask my mother but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abraf-ckingcadabra motherf-cker look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring
First I Re-up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see Nyquil

Oh no
Here we go again
When it's going to end
Where did it begin
Maybe way back when

Into the well, baby Jessica fell
She may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail
Every day in journals saying how
She wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man

My medical marijuana was prescribed by a doctor
Shove a typewriter up her
Perez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
And f-ck it while I'm venting let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard's bare
Stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there

Vicodin like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who am I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
I'm nice when I'm like this, no time to write just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man I'm about to hyperventilate, I just have hyper-tension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again</p>
]

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive"
"Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, whoosh

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy

I've been driving around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peaked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand
Surprised to see me, cat got your tongue
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt?
This should be fun
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M&amp;M
Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
Oh, God, police! Ahh!
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, Yeah ‘cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult
That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you the
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers left off</p>
]

Eminem: hellbound
yo. slim shady!
yo. i'll fuckin. i'll.
i'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
battle? i'm too weeded to speak to
the only key that i see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
i'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
you'll think i pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you
(bitch!) i ain't no fuckin g, i'm a cannibal
i ain't tryin to shoot you,
i'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
i'm so bananas i'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it
while i sit back and just hope it catches
blow you to fragments
laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
(repeat 2x)
I see the light at the end
but every time i take a step, it gets dim
tell me is this hell we're livin in?
if so, heaven's got to be better
but if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
am i the worst? because i, never go to church (never)
i run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
i'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
leave the e.r., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
one day we all gon' die
but when i die, i'ma be so high
that i'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
i smoke 'til i choke and i sex a lot
i got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
now if i pray everynight (night)
do i still have to hold my trey very tight?
you feel me god? i done did so much shit while on earth
i smoke, i drink, i curse, and to make matters worse
i bust my gun first, and then i chat with your corpse
since way back, i was one to never like back-talk
see me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a nordface
nickel nine at my waist, god done lost faith
angels greet me but i don't reply back
just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's thai at?

analyze the strength of my game, like lee corso
call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
and of course, yo, y'all know i'm no stranger to danger
like christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
i breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
and beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
my pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
tie your wife to the back of a black jag and i drag her
ten blocks, untie the bitch and i still bag her
give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
my shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
my flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
everyday i grow more older, and more colder
fly you to colorado, roll you over with a boulder
i know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care
but every time i take a step it gets dim, tell me is this hell we're livin in</p>

Whatever
Dre just let it run
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen

Ey yo
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
And this bag, of this weed
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me, recently
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!"
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
'Cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
And look at where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is"
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
You've been driving me crazy
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am</p>

And everyone should get along:
Okay children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like toduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that ()
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia ()
Good luck Mr. Shady

Hi there, little boys and girls ()
Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels

But first I'd like you to meet my friend Bob ()
Say hi Bob (Hi Bob), Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
He don't got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block

And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
Till one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job
When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uh
You couldn't even take him to to give Bob a doctor

Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found her
And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner

And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you:
See children, drugs are bad (come on)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (raise your hand)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
And there's really nothing else to say (sing along)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world

If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

Meet Zach, 21 years old
After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

Suddenly, he starts to convulse, and his pulse
Goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes roll back in his skull
His back arches up, looks like the McDonalds arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'

And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him."
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

Meanwhile Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga
And that's the story of Zach: the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you:
See children, drugs are bad (that's right)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
And there's really nothing else to say (Uh huh)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay

And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it (Yum yum)

And then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)
Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair

"Mr. Shady, what's a g-string?", it's yarn Clair
Women stick them up their behinds, go out and wear 'em
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops did I say magic mushrooms, I meant fungus

Your tongue gets, all swole up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at

But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't drugs and do exactly as I don't, because I'm bad for you:
See children, drugs are bad (uh huh)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can ask)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (and she will)

So kids say no to drugs (say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
And there's really nothing else to say (that's right)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay:
Come on children, clap along ()
Sing along children ()
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad ()
So don't do drugs ()
So there'll be more for me (Mushrooms killed Kenny!...Ewww, ahhh!)(]So, fucked up, right now.)]</p>

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got 'em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways fuck it
What's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too
I'm out to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam

I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this, man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote
I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad
I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didn't have to
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man

He's only 6 years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For 4 hours and you just said "No"
That's pretty shitty man
You're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you, you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
It's like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous
'Cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like
I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
You've gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word
I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you
I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now
I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?

You know this song by Phil Collins
'From the Air in the Night'
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him

That's kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late
I'm on a thousand downers now I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we could have been together
Think about it, you ruined it now

I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you can't breathe without me

See Slim, "Shut up bitch!
I'm trying to talk"
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up
See I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
And then she'll die too

Well gotta go
I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner
But I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look I'm really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show
I must have missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin' dawg
C'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls
When you get down some
And what's this shit about us mean to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us
To meet each other

I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you'd relax a little

I'm glad I inspire you
But Stan, why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didn't say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was... it was you.

Damn.!</p>

Featuring: Eminem

Gee wilikers gatman they got me surrounded
I'm on my way

I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch shady I'll leave you dearly departed
They say batman

Robin, cagney or lacey, it's 50 cent and shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my people
I'll be act crazy, put a hole thru ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an iv
I'll leave ya witnesses when I ride b
You fuck with me, you see
I'll be actin' like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art
Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Will daint ya, anger will change ya
And make ya aim that and squeeze

I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a batman

Mothafucka you retarded,
You touch 50, I'll leave you dearly departed
We're walkin away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said, were walkin away, did you hear me? you oughta
Be thankful that we aint beefin. were still breathin and just
leave it at that
That's when me and 50 and g-unit hop back in the bat
Mobile it aint gonna be no more rap its gonna be rrrat
Retaliation will be like them muslim shiite attacks
Some where along the line its like me and 50 made pact
He's got my back, I got his back, back
Its almost like were kinda, like siamese twins
Cuz when we beef, we pull each other in,
To the bull shit like were conjoined at the hip,
Its just unavoidable, some of the shit is squashable
Some shit'll never bother us
Some of it will just simmer at best, if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sit downs
With no daves and 'zinos
There will be no peace discussions with me
There aint gone be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin with me and ill gladly quit fuckin with you
Just spit ya 16 and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin me or the machine or jimmy iovine
Or dre or 50 or d-twizzy, obie and just let it be
Or we'll be back with a:.

Gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a batman
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch shady I'll leave you dearly departed

Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got 'em on the screen, I'm plottin' in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetary visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, 'cause I live it
Showcases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
They say no, niggas <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dfbab1bcb0adba80bbeeed9fb7b4b1b0a8" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">email protected]</a> how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect ai, m you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man its so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch shady I'll leave you down
Leave the party</p>

I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught if you see these on fire
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park, no fire department
So you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dawg
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder
Widely regarded, highly, bite me, sweetheart, I'm slightly retarded
But tonight I'm starting shit, I'm feeling self righteous
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of the LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver from movement
Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, unpacked it and boxed it
Toxic, hands are arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content

Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs that'll slaughter

Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
Black out, Zach Galifianakis, gallons of Vodka
But that gal has some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Max in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich

And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious

Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I'll stand there and yell that at a wall
Until the mannequin doll scatter the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'mma spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back,
I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
And I'd catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack of Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door is laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malign now, she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
Cause now she's faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's "Control" verse
And perform Fack in concert
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
(I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for
What's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so meh
Still get along with this voice cause that's the monster
So do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio, meh
She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, wooh, Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing the head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan
Bandwagoners, I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on a ass</p>
]

I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryna seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you…
Roses are violet, mollys are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
Cuz I think I started hallucinatin'
Cuz I just thought I
heard Jay Electronica &amp; Odd Future's new shit
&amp; all I can do is follow the music
&amp; end up wit Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Filling water balloons wit nail polish remova.
Just a pop 'em and wallow in fumes I…
feel uptight I got to get loosa
Afta I finish polishin' off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted
Cuz all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi but that hoochie did pass
Ya see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like…
" I'm Marshall"
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya
Oh I'm a mysogonist too but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
(uh!)
A chronic abuser…
and not only user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of ya losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, &amp; a nuke
&amp; a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood so…
When I say I'm bringin' the Tech out
I'm not comin' to repair your fucking electronic computers
God…
I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofa
I'm TORE UP…
demolished, I'm fucking stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are… L**Ny TuN3$
The box of reusable latex gloves &amp; the socks &amp; the shoes

2 replace Nextel-Veronica's boobs

&amp; the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in a glove box

In a blue Honda wit used condoms were clues the…
girl was just not the one suitable for…
Right fo' me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be just right for…
you &amp; me, dont laugh, please listen!
Dont laaaugh…
(youralltraptinmyhead!)
Thought Id give in to the pressure
Collapse &amp; crumble…
perhaps relapsing under that
Well that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Cap'n Crunch of rap
&amp; I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
Cuz push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled had some struggles yeah
but that passionate hunger's back
A fantastic juggling act
&amp; the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact…
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fucking crashed my hovercraft
Afta I strapped the duffel bag to my back
&amp; stuck the massive punchin' bag in it
An elastic bungee strap, rubber plaster, a thumb tack
&amp; a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic &amp; fuckin' snapped
Jumped &amp; splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back-flipped
&amp; landed on a gymnastic tumble-mat!…
&amp; for my last trick, lunge on back
latch on a N.A.S.A. shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half

Chuckled &amp; laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal

&amp; just asked him to come crash

&amp; I go grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress

&amp; ceramic construction hat, rubbed my magic mushroom tat 4 luck

then splat…
get up from that

Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up then gas, lungs collapsed
&amp; that's mo' likely than finding someone that's
Right fo' me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be
Just Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be just right for…
you &amp; me, dont laugh, please listen!
Dont laaaugh…
(youralltraptinmyhead!)
Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fucking-cumbobulation
Flooded wit thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably sum' of ya got 2 thinking
'You're top 10, ain't ya?' stop cuz ya fuckas are talking crazy
&amp; stop interrupting you're not even up in that conversation!…
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless, whateva yo job is
I came 2 fuck wit yo occupation
You're thinking just cuz ya came in with scrubs
&amp; ya brought the scalpel &amp; sponge
The oxygen tank &amp; the suction &amp; shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once ya done swapped names wit him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan, if you dug him up -&gt; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles bacon
a fucking McDonald's egg &amp; cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table
Then bump it &amp; knock it shake it…
Jumped &amp; got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said

FUCK IT!

&amp; lost my patience
they all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of ya Doctor Dre so then what does it got ya thinking
Ya can fuck wit this operation?! aftamath
still running hip-hop amazing
I'm still plugging along, no need for assumption
Here's confirmation, I'm up fo' the long duration…
I'm just looking fo' sumethin' 2 walk away wit

Sum' pocket change &amp; a lil integrity
Tho' I'll probably be jumping across the stage
Till I'm fucking Madonna's age &amp;…
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit ya not like I'm fucked up wit constipation
That day will come where I finally stumble upon sum' lady thats
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head 2 be just right for…
you &amp; me, dont laugh, please listen!
Dont laaaugh…

Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though
Oh well, this is my life so as I go and try to close for the night's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because alls I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless it's fucked, when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
With a balance beam. If I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
But my conscience allows me to think the most foulish, childish things
Without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin' for the crowds
They're screaming in The Palace, sold out this evening
But now as I lay me down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying

So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals I'm so vain
I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
Cause this ice layer
I skate on's a nice way of putting it, but I like stayin'
Feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
It's funny, this house is quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song, vicious cycle ain't it?!
Then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line
This goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or you sold your soul

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back
To me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
Hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying

But I keep walkin' the line...</p>

I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught if you see these on fire
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park, no fire department
So you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dawg
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder
Widely regarded, highly, bite me, sweetheart, I'm slightly retarded
But tonight I'm starting shit, I'm feeling self righteous
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of the LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver from movement
Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, unpacked it and boxed it
Toxic, hands are arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content

Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs that'll slaughter

Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
Black out, Zach Galifianakis, gallons of Vodka
But that gal has some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Max in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich

And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious

Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I'll stand there and yell that at a wall
Until the mannequin doll scatter the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'mma spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back,
I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
And I'd catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack of Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door is laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malign now, she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
Cause now she's faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson

Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doin he're?
Get me outta here

We don't play those games
This is gettin' wild
Can you tell me how?
Let me out now

We don't play those games
How'd I get in here?
Let me outta here
What I'm doin' here?

We don't play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap 2K1

I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill

I made it to the next level: Above Ground
My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And that's when this A&amp;R crawled from under a rock
And start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll
Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves
I'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over</p>

Guess who? You miss me?

Shady man no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashians a man

On her massive Gluteus maximus again

{*yawns*} Yeah, look

If I would've rap about the crap that's out, that's the route
you probably want me to take cause you're just dyin to know what I think
Here my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin about Paul Wall you'd probably crap in your pants
Cause I'm white and he's white, so he's like
my competition I mean, right? Nope
Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so
{*blblblbl, pbbbbt*} B-b-b-b-b-b, but
I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite break
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em, full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g–g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"

My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

+ (devil)
(Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here
Talk to me, sit, here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? {*laughs*}
Dye it back, c'mon try it) AHHHH!
No I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you?!
(But I'm here to rebuild you) But I already killed you!
(But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother) Yeah, so what of her?
(You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes) FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
I had you beat! (No, I was playin possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm takin it back!) You fuckin bitch, WHY?!
(Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Hahaha!)

My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

+ (devil)
(Shady, listen – "SHADY!" - you hear that?
They're screamin for you, I can bring your career back)
But I don't want it back (Yes you do) no I don't
(Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later) No I won't
(I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor)
Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday
(Well I got him on the phone right now)

+ (Eminem)
Slim (you're lyin) yo Slim! (How, why now?)
(Whattup Dre?) Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
drugs you became a lot softer
(But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka)
Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up (FUCK THIS MIRROR!)

{*glass breaks*}

+ (devil)
AHHH! (I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you) FUCK YOU, DIE YOU
SON-OF-A-BITCH! {*gun cocks*} (Put the gun down) Bye-bye!
{*blam*} Okay, I'm still alive (so am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you
prayed to God you'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you're just now seein the downside to?
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you?
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall) WHAT?! (No one's gonna love you like I do)

My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I said I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body {*echoes*}</p>

Psst, hey, listen

I love my job
It makes me feel like, superman
Can you fly, I can, wanna see

I'm only entertaining you
My, goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you

My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics constantly took out of context

Failure to communicate with congress
Has, been a problem for the longest I guess
But, maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest

Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark

There's a ray
There's a light
There's a hope
There's a spark

But when planets collide
They'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide
To set the differences aside

And this is why
Only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead
And feel the vibe because

I'm only entertaining you
My, goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you

My, music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, It might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it, I get sick of trying to explain it

See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on

Constantly movin', constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like

I'll be here when y'all are gone re-building
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy, probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then cause

I'm only entertaining you
My, goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you

My, lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
Alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate

I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, Slim you're great
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain

'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced, and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain

But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts, but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust

I'm only entertaining you
My, goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you</p>

Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino
It don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle
'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentioning *Suge*
And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down talking the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, because

There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't going to go after him
Until Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?
Well fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm copping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit popping
Off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause</p>

Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then slip
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
And go follow the footsteps I'm makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
if the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
I'm torn in my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road</p>

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from
When you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzing
Cause you got the windows up
Blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did something to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I, still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin'
I don't give a fuck I don't play!
Bitch you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gaping hole in it
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
Tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
But by the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, sons you like an ultra violet ray
I'm selling hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm shittin' on competition
In the meantime it's always mean time

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'mma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
It's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
Cry til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs
I keep on falling down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a (like a) fucking (fucking)
Echo (echo)... (Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle
Spiraling, here I go, I'm outta control like no
Other mic go, stab you til' the knife goes - dull
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
Coz I'mma sock it to you
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night so
Strike up the fucking maestro, I'm nitro
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole
Deeper, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

Ohh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
Shit...
Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then
Blow it out your ass</p>

What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack
On Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work, so we moved
Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline, last thing I wanna do
Is listen she's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Krypton-
-ite to the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman, cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion

I remember it clearly, even today

Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma nan
Always itching for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered
This DJ who was mixing, I say it to this day, if you ain't listened
To the wizard, you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J cooling system
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this, that's how I know my mission
Little boom box booming, spitting, practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go complete ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us
Too existed to do this shit, never quit, too persistent

We are the underground empire

Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, cause if they caught you slipping
They'd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
And you forgot your written, opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding-dong ditching shit, I fucking got that bitch
In a headlock, cut off his oxygen Slim, it's not cordial
Like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind, now I got my pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, hopping over that opposition
Looking like a dog is pissing, leg up on the competition
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague bombing 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em, like stomping 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your bluebirds? Ooh
No more tripping in bird shit, this songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this discouraging
The Rap Game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift, cause all I got is bars
For you dumbbells and doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first, and you ain't got to wear
No shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served bloodthirst, revenge of a nerds

They will not escape my vengeance

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the Uncle Ron, I'm turning into an unhumble Don
You blind dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched up your arm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fucking Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
Soot, charred debris floating like Oakwood
Was burning, return of the no good and I don't quit

And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane

And I don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, so you can't pop your head

I'm not so sure I want to know from once it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing</p>
]

One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one "ouch"
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory
storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby

But
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad

And get's to throwing a tantrum

He'll fucking flip on ya
Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya

Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum

He'll fucking flip on ya
What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat cos' I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one

Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people

Is like me having my teeth pulled
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god cus' If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
Cos when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya</p>

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you - aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
For battles sucka - duck, crawl out the back
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)"
Oh, my bad. Slut
And next time I show to in court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You're so fucking gravy, Marshall I should start calling you 'au jus'
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker
(Rape your mother, kill your parents) And these kids are like parrots, they run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming, "fuck, shit, fuck" adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like, merits
Fuck that - I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics
Dreamy eyes", but my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition (ha ha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies

There's darkness closing in (evil twin)
There it goes again (my evil twin)
It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend
Who pops up now and again
So don't blame me (evil twin)
Just blame him, it's my evil twin)
(I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

So who's left, Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burning to death but I'm freezing
Bed ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker, Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch, Give up my dick for pussy?
I'd be Jerry Mathers, I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden, it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun
At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "Fuck the police" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an Evil Twin
So who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass
Like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause I'm so sick of being the truth, I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh LMFAO, no way, Jo-
Se Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, (hey ho) Hey-ho!
I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking to "Hip Hop Hooray", no
I'm hollering you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
Let your low end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancing or bowling?
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm looking for romance cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a bo-ner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same, bitch</p>

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering my heart's jittering
Just you and i
Not tonight come tomorrow
When ev'rything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No no no come tomorrow 'cause then
We'll be waiting in the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay awhile

You know I never could forsee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Can't you see that I just don't know

No not tonight not tomorrow
Ev'rything's gonna be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow we'll be
As happy as we're feeling tonight
We'll go walking in the moonlight (we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight

I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
(just you and I) just you and i
Just you and i
Can't you see that we've gotta be together
Be together just you and I just you and i
No more questions just you and i</p>

"Breaking news, Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour
to check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction
to sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops."
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently
survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be
a random drive-by shooting. Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be...
alienated... on again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire
at an after-hours club we've learned that the rapper Proof
has been fatally shot."
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem, and a member of the rap group D12."
"D12 back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation
continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break
but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask,
'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
There's somethin changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster, I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert, I was rakin in the dough, rollin in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losin my freedom, there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it, every CD critics gave it a 3
then three, years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called "The Slim Shady LP" the greatest
"The Marshall Mathers" was a classic, "The Eminem Show" was fantastic
But "Encore" just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be "Illmatic"
And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld

I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been prayin for me
Every day and for some reason it's been weighin on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But somethin told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
at least, a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin it from a opposite standpoint, man boy it's got to look
nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
right now on how, to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld</p>

Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, or your problems
Everything, and follow me

If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
And shit you're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just

Lose yourself in this music, this moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go), you better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate

Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you close loose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The skies the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage, of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck because they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it</p>

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I.
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window.
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad.

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too

Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim; *screaming*] Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
. . Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning dogg,
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was. it was you
Damn!</p>

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid!
(Yeah)
To take a stand, to take a stand
(It's been a ride)
Everybody, everybody
(I guess I had to)
Come take my hand, come take my hand
(Go to that place to get to this one)

We'll walk this world together through the storm
(Now some of you)
Whatever weather, cold or warm
(Might still be in that place)
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
(If you're tryin' to get out)
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
(Just follow me, I'll get you there)

You can try read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something, I do it, I don't give a damn what you think

I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony

No if, ands, or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to that last "Relapse" album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck-you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got
The urge to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was the king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD, was "eh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click clack, pow
'Cause I ain't playin' around, it's the game called circlin'
I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons, these motherfuckers are doing jumping-jacks now

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand

We'll walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage

I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Tryin' to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I've been through the ringer, but take it through little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama, from now I wanna promise to focus only
On handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquour counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin'

And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand

We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road</p>

A lotta people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know, i'm back now, haha
Dre, I'm down here under the ground
Dig me up, broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
60 sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of oxy pads
Enough oxy cotton to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Whack job in a bag and a black stalkin' cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxin' match
He can't say that, yes he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
You better text message to your next of kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Throw a fuckin' lesbian in wetzy men
So faggidy, faggidy, faggidy, raggidy Ann and Andy
No, raggidy, Andy and Andy, no, it can't be, it can't be
Yes, it can be, the fuckin' Antichrist is back
Danny and Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity
Goddamn it, insanity pills, fanny pack filled with zanies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk negligee, lookie
Razor blades with me to make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline make up layin' on the table with weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Six semen samples, 17 strands of hair
Found at the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe and canopy beds
And glad bags, yeah, glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicadin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lighten the strikin', might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means is just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
So tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shootin' animal
Light up a cannon and have him catapult addin' a dog
Captain of the cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Voorhees with a 40
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in a fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' wiffle bat, Drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands, too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity, can it be vanity? Where is the humanity?
And havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
Cut your fuckin' head off and ask you where you headed off to
Get it, headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground</p>

Better watch out suck-a now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught comin' and I'm packin' in my lunch-a
Buncha missle launchers 'n a buncha contra
Ban-van full of ganja, now come on ja-
Man stop! Man said, "Marshall, Oh-my-God, ya
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quad-ra-
Polegic, boogyin down to Frank Sinatra."
Lindsey to the Lohan, naked will you let me watch ya?
Who'd-a knew the pew'd-a do to me what it's done?
Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system.
Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son,
So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks,
"Mista, help me"'s what he said to me, and then sunk.
Women, skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks,
In clumps - the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways-
Carcasses of caucasian females in his crawlspace.
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place?
Hide 'em in the wall- well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I've got nothin' but time- I'll wait.
Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin',
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within.
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin',
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin' to fight? You will never win.
Severin legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?
Nothin', so chill. Fuckin' hoe, ya better fuckin' hold still.
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.
Cut 'em, gut 'em 'n just get to stuffin' those girls.
Man, I think she had enough of those pills,
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel blades,
Baby when I cut ya don't squeal,
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearin' voices, like "Wouldn't ya like to go an' get your butcher knife,
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers
into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her
What ya usually do to a girl whose skin's newer?"
"In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin' into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are."
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.
Boo-ya, who ya think you're fuckin' with? Duck, because here he comes again.
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.</p>

SharePlay
L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fail
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells

You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells

The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells

Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers wanna do this well
Rock the bells

Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells

The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells

So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
All you're gonna be, wanna be, when will you learn
Wanna be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six Gs for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well
Rock the bells</p>

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phantom believe me clowns

That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only

One with the balls and your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' your boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga

Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin the floors
With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long 'til this sport is O V
E R, just blazin' and we are knockin' them doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be

Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S N double O P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over

And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh

And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no

For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself

Yes, it's the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rap
So I'mma fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life

Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate
I'mma need two mics
'Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong
I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped

Just finished the rhyming bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always

Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below

Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew

You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, nah, Doody you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof

Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no</p>

Keeo on going you just gotta fight it
keep on going cause its never too late
you cant back down
you cant back down

keep on going you just gotta fight it
keep on going cause its never too late

you cant back down
you can back down</p>
]

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife  in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me, and I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know, my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin', fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship, isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize,
even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of
The games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, 
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie</p>

F-ck an intro man, lets go.
I come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up better not let them breath
last shot give it all you got
try to turn me down b-tch get f-cked with the volume nob
f-ck all you snobs
hoes I hope all you rott
2 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought
and you wanna menage a trois you twats
f-ck that I'd rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
get as rowdy as Roesthlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leech stuck in a vacuum your only nothin but a whole lot of suckin'
goin' on in rap
yeah but I'm home
Bad to the bone
Back in the zone
Let him alone
You don't wanna go eggin' him on

It'll never be my chair that your on
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
otherwords there's no heir to the throne
when I die so does hip hop
hitchcock better sh-t bitch ass got a zip locked in a bag
you fags aint been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
Keep bloggin while I mind boggle in my zone like i'm in the twilight, dog.

Get off my bone, this is my mic doggonit, and I like hoggin' it

flow so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganing
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplex it on cement like I'm on some straight outta compton sh-t
take this d-ck and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can b-tch slap a back handed compliment
jack ass eat a donkey d-ck
the game I just about conquered it like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey sh-t, I reign supreme in this honkey sh-t
no sense screaming and arguing
makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in
you think you ball well I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omlette
but you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch I'm as bat sh-t as Ozzy it's obvious
you can tell I go right off the bat
no pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head
tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
I give as much as a flying f-ck as that superman dude
guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and bamboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the f-ck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock block like a square f-cking male chicken
yeah, it's shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin
(haha recovery)</p>
]

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape

Cupid shot his arrow and missed, wait Sarah you're late
Your train left; mascara and eggs smeared on your face

Night's over, good bye ho I thought that I told ya

That spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never should've came within range of my Rover
Should've known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller, well I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock &amp; Rye Cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fuckin' chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Trying to pull five bucks from me is like trying to pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swoll up, I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch? you're already bi-polar!
Man TIP told me on this ho tip, best tip I could give you to help you
Is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole? Take the shovel and dig you some dignity, bitch

Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone, tell me to stick to my guns

Like double stick it's you, but fuck ‘em TIP, it's cool
I'm chilling like a villain like the penguin in its fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you

I'll give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts
But it won't buy you a cheeseburger

But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
There's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way for shizzle
I still live like I budget a Gilbert's Lodge check stub, bizzle
So fuck Sizzler these checkers are bust like a blood blister
Yeah I guess life is a bitch, ain't it TIP? And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now, but in case you didn't
I'll stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it
Double timin it', but I still spit triple the amount

Of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on, while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant, well I guess I'm wrong

But if you gonna tell me that A&amp;W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the "F" on dawg
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over and that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Ya, goodnight it's over, and that's all she wrote</p>

Saturday morning jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me we will be boys
Standing at that altar
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still 'No"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Rude

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say, I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but 'No' still means 'No'!

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Why you gotta be so rude?</p>

I've had it for the last time
you're actions got me hot as my last rhyme
you're options will either get put out greenwich or as fine
fine just aint gon cut it
drama is what you're in love with
you're one of them b-tches you run with
lately I'm feeling smothered
(?) conceited with cover girl motives
I gotta rise above it
you think them models loving me
I'm thinking bout dozen, doesn't really matter what you say
sickness in my stomach,
told you I was gon be splitting, you don't think I mean it
meant it, everything I got, f-ck you
ain't no secret no apologies you keep it
now that I'm doing my thing and you peep it
the badder times all outweigh the recent
your energy who needs it
every rumour you hear you go believe it
point out the times you've seen it
you stabbed me should linked it
revenge is mine, i need it, need a way out
it's my f-cking life, let her find a way to stay out
bet you thought (?) aint that easy
bet you thought I need you a million times before you need me
leave me everything that I gave to you
aint no freebies get your coat and go
the female pinnochio, money hungry, hopeless hoe
you f-cking with my focus so
go back to that trunk that played the role before
love is like a cancer when you don't let go
I'mma blow fo 'sho
unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don't need you sinking us
I hope you float, lying through my teeth I hope you don't
(drown, drown)
now the sound of every (?)
bottles pop out while he smoke
hit me pride that we broke
let them girls crowding me go
if they got something to show
let em show me how I love, I'm never lonely
never even left a scar
you fell hard, I'm laughing
ha ha ha ha ha
tyre smoke fancy car
nothing is what we are
no beginning no tomorrow
cause I'm moving on, don't worry about me
cause I'm gon be aight without you, you'll see
there aint no-one on this Earth I'd much rather be cause God-dammit
I'm glad that I'm me

I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
you'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
but you don't so you just feel like you

I'm moving on, don't worry about me
cause I'm gon be just fine without you, you'll see
there aint no-one on this Earth right now I'd rmuch rather be
cause God-dammit I'm glad that I'm me

I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
you'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
but you don't so you just feel like you

I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
you'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
but you don't so you just feel like you

...the relationship, ships sink
you know it's love as soon as you fall in it
cause sh-t stinks
and it feels like every time I f-cking do I get jinxed
cupid must have put a curse on me
6 weeks went by and we only spoke twice
I'm sitting in your driveway calling you from the car
suffice I think its safe to say your not at home
I'm calling your cell phone, you answer
but I can tell though you're not alone
how was I to know, it should have been time to go a long time ago
I kept holding on
its comical when I think back now I couldn't get the hint
you feel the draft...</p>
]

Only reason I dissed you in the first place
is cause you denied seein me
Now I'm pissed off
Sit back homie relax, in fact grab a six-pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah Dre, sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear somethin wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm (Obsesseed) now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me, in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch shut the fuck up, 'fore I put all them phone calls out
you made to my house when you was (Wild'n Out) before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin to count
Better shut your lyin mouth if you don't want Nick findin out
You probably think cause it's been so long
if I had somethin on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary Mary Poppins I'm mixin our studio session down
and sendin it to masterin to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do, Mariah it ever occur to you
that I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
and that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
that made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky? Tell the public
that I was so ugly that you fuckin had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin, that's gotta count for somethin
Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about
how I nutted early cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
and said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin me I'm embarrassin you
And don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin airplay I'm dissin you
I'm a hair away from gettin carried away and gettin sued
I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
This is 34 bars, we ain't even third of the way through
"Damn Slim, Mariah play you," Mariah who?
Oh, did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I been goin off on you all this time
for no reason, girl you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
on an episode of "Cribs," a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin your jibs
Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin this shit again hoe, you know what it is
It's a warnin shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and, I'll release every fuckin thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
when me and Luis were tryin to stick two CD's in the same slot

"Slim Shady... "
"Slim Shady..."

{"I love you"} I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear boo
Now what you say? {"It's nothin"} Yeah so what I'll do
is refresh your memory when you said {"I want you"}
Now should I, keep goin or should we call truce?
{"You think you're cute, right?"} You bet your sweet ass I do
{"I'm Mary Poppins, B"} And I'm Superman, ooh
{"Mary P - Slim Shady"} Comin at you
So if you'll still be my {"Baby girl"}
Then I'll still be your {"Superhero"}
{"Wilma M."} Yeah, I'm right here
{"You like this!"} Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a {"knife"} when I tell you get a {"life"}
But I'm movin on with mine, Nick, is that your {"wife"}
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't {"stick to the script"} then I'ma just keep goin
Damn

"I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's sayin cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife!"</p>

All aboard, okay... Next stop, my basement... haha, I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide,
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's an honour who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking AV
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's is in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre

Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason slash leatherface n'
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner snitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass doctor dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one breif second
And you pussy queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof

He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him

Eighty something million records worldwide,
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Thinkin' about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em, just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fuckin-A even got a biday
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator</p>

Eminem]
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
You'll never touch my.

Catch me if you can but you ain't man enough
You're standin' tough
But you know that no matter what
You'll never get the chance to touch
My ballz, ballz, ballz
Ballz, ballz, ballz
You'll never touch my ballz

I see you ain't a playa, you ain't ballin'
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talkin'
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is "get your man up off him"
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talkin'
And I ain't gotta prove you nothin'
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons

This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doin' this for years, my team can't lose
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me a guard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this 'fore you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm foldin'
Damn it, call holton

Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up
I'm reachin' up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus yikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the Run it back, wrong song, yeah disreguard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
On 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball
To the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god dang high, that he's trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put???
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and its now fourth now
We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'ma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on
Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touchdown yeah I told you
It's the longest yard

The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball
I'ma run through all of ya'll, ya'll just soft
Even though my cleats is kickin' up mud
It's more tragic for me, I'm stiff armin' punks
High steppin' through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playin' ball with killas, my team's the realest
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best runnin' backs there never was
Movin' like Barry Sanders, leavin' you in the dust

Yack is high, I got the highest yack
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snaps like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin' my eye, a Mack truck tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin' backwards
Wide reciever, recievin' wide
For every stride in my life, yo I breathe and die

Defense is playin' a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams (blue 43)
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excell
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flyin' through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For bein' the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone (touchdown!)
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

Footballs
I'm talkin' about footballs dude</p>

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was illAnnotate-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over – enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Raise your, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all</p>

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So (everybody, everybody)] (go berserk)

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho...

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy; let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So (everybody, everybody)] (go berserk)

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur's Cargo's
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.

Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up
And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.

Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'm a stop pinnin' 'em and
I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'm a stop sendin'
'em, women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not

Get the illin' to stop, amoxacillin's just not real enough

The criminal cop killin' hip-hop villiana
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock,
Is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up?

Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot
Listen up,
You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck

Till the roof comes off,
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out

Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high, perhaps?
I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin'
You get when you're real, and you spit and people are feelin' ya shit
This is your moment,
And every single minute you get try'n hold on to it
'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over

Just admit when it's at it's end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list
Here's the order of my list that it's in -
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac...

Where my thugs at
Huh, increase the doses, bustin whoever closest
Thug livin, hell or prison, never losin my focus
I'm makin money moves manditory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin
Til the cops come runnin, duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch, waitin to trick me, not the life for me
Livin carefree, til I'm buried - and if they dare me
I'm bustin on niggaz until they scurry, I'm clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed

Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin my soul?
Got tired of small time livin, niggaz tellin me no
I got MINE, FUCK THEM OTHER SUCKERS, that's the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz
I know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time
Well here it is nigga here it is

No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef til I burn
Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggaz do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin

And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? Gettin blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walkin close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz

Soon as a starts I eat at an MCs heart, what is he thinkin'
About to go against me?, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my
Spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth
That would be the death of me first
'cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could
Ever be worse that's why I'm
Clever when I put together every
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like
I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack,
Like I'm Kim Mathers

But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin'
At them, the track is on some
Battlin' rap who wants some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that
I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest

Until the roof, (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs, (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me,
I, I will not fall,
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can
Beat me</p>
]

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So (everybody, everybody)] (go berserk)

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho...

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy; let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So (everybody, everybody)] (go berserk)

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur's Cargo's
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So (everybody, everybody)] (go berserk)

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, all your problems
Everything, and follow me

If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
You're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)

Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)</p>

Whatever

Dre, just let it run
Hey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
...

Just shut up and listen, Hey yo

Hey yo.
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this ... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully (peacefully...)
But at least have the decency in you
...
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (speak to me...) I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N*Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty...)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet...) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin'...)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am

Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content -
That song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me...)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn...) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at

Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin this happenin (this happenin...)
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way...)

But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin and I have returned
And I am, whatever you say I am

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish, that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on 'My Name Is'
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience...)
To deal with these cocky caucasians
who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black, cause I talk with an accent
And grab on my balls, so they always keep askin
The same fuckin questions (fuckin questions...)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in

The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out (ahhh)
Cause they drivin me crazy (me crazy...) I can't take it
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom without someone standin by it

No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
but your picture on my wall

it's not so bad..

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; f*** it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend killed] himself over some b**** who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground s*** that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the s*** you did with Ruckus too, that s*** was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's f***ed up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty sh**ty man - you're like his f**kin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, thoiugh, i just don't like bein lied to
Remeber when we met in Denver, you said if I write to you you would write back
See, i'm just like you in way
I never knew my father neither, he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when i have a sh**ty day, i drift away and put em on
Cuz i ain't really got s**t else so that s**t helps when i'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut] myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cuz you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka], dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air Tonight"
About that guy, who coulda saved that other guy from drownin,
But didn't then Phil saw it all then at that show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drownin
No it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, i'm drowsy
And all i wanted, was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know i ripped all of your pictures of the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up b****! I'm trying to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend 
but I didn't, I just tied her up], see I ain't like you
cause if she she'll suffer more, and then she'll die], too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh s**t, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this s**t out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that s**t intentionally just to diss you
And what's this s**t you said about you like to cut] your wrists too?
I say that shit] just clowning dog,
c'mon - how f**ked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this s**t about us meant to be together?
That type of s**t'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit]
I seen this one s**t on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk], and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn!</p>

So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Famed to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me (in) to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert

I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it

Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least

A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold</p>

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.

I told the World one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubt's start to creep in, everyday is so gray and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for em
They just say it's wack
They don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
It was you who picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon hug me

But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause…

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor

I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.

It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there pieces so I'm puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Cant make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more
I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours

But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying I need you, come back for fuck's sake...

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor

I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them I don't see none of 'em
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, faggots
You gon see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?

You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little cracker jack beat making wack math
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream 'Dre, don't leave us like that man' cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life.</p>

Detroit
There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who would drive to you, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people
Stay up Detroit.</p>

Yeah, look

If I woulda rap about the crap that's out, that's the route
You probably want me to take cause you're just dying to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your pants
Cause I'm White and he's White, so he's like my competition I mean, right
Nope, Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so b-b-b-b-b-b
But I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in em and fill em, full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em
And let em know that I just don't feel em
And smack 'em with the backwards E on the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face 'em
Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"

My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here
Talk to me, sit, here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? Dye it back, come on, try it"
Ahh, no! I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you" But I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for each other, think about your mother"
Yeah, so what of her?
"You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes" Fuck you mothafucka!
I had you beat! "No, I was playin possum, remember?
I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm takin it back" You fuckin bitch, why?!
"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster?"

"Shady, listen (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"
But I don't want it back "Yes, you do" No I don't
"Yes, you do, you're gonna regret it later" No I won't
"I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
"Well I got him on the phone right now"
(Slim) You're lying! (Yo, Slim) How, why now?
What up Dre? (Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all Shady is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) Fuck this mirror!
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you"
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch "Put the gun down"
Bye-bye! Okay, I'm still alive "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside too
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle, Marshall"
What?! "No one's gonna love you like I do"</p>

This motherfucker man! Just won't shut up will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him, bitch you owe me
I'm promoting you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in his coffin

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap
(Nope)

And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that, so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

I would never claim to be no, Ray Benzino
An eighty-three year old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
(Ugh!)

Please don't, you'll probably fall with me
And our asses'll both be history
But then again you'd finally get your wish
'Cause you'll be all over the street like 50 Cent
(Ha ha ha)

Fuckin' punk pussy, fuck you chump
Give me a one on one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tryin' to jump the Ruff Ryderz and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck, dick

In the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances, 'cause real lyricists

Don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you we hate you period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shaking Obie Trice's hand

Now he's a buster? What the fucks with that
Get on a track dissing us and kissin 50's ass
And asking me what I know about indictments, bite me
Bitch I got two cases, and probation, fight me!

What do I know about standing in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world?

A little girl and I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no shopping rocks
But what you know about hip hop shops rocking spots?

Were you the only white boy up in the bitch just rippin'?
Pressing up your own flyers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spending six hours at Kinko's
Just making copies of your covers to cassette singles

To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spending your whole paychecks at Disk Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white
(Ha ha ha)

Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now!

Kill a motherfucker dead, kill 'em dead bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin head, go ahead bitch!
Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya

'Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
If you was really sellin' coke with, then what the fuck
You stop for dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money then you do from rap
(Ha ha ha)

You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch ain't it?
Raymond? Here let me break the shit down in Laymen's
Terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it

Since Canibus is using too many complicated fuckin words for you
Here let me slow it down for so you could understand if I say it slower
Let it go dogg, it's over

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap
(Uh, ugh)

And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that, so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

Ha ha, talking 'bout, I have motherfuckers calling your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib!
You ain't even got a fucking phone, fucking bum
Threatenin' to shut me down at ya lil' fucking Source magazine
If I come back when did I attack you?

Bitch, you attacked me first take it like a man
And shut the fuck up, fuck your little magazine too
I don't need your little fucking magazine
I got XXL's number anyways

And y'all can't stand it 'cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watching me from whatever fuckin' TV

You was watching me from, from Boston
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin' sissy
And you got us scared up in that motherfucker?
Suck my motherfuckin' dick

Oh! And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted y'all
The Source has a white owner!</p>
